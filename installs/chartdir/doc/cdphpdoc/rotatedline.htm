This example demonstrates swapping the x and y axes to produce a rotated line chart in which the line goes from top to bottom (instead of left to right).<br><br>
The x and y axes in the example are configured as follows:<br><br>
<ul><li> Initially, the direction of the x-axis is left to right and is at the bottom of the chart, while the y-axis is from bottom to top and is on the left of the chart.<br><br>
<li> Swap the x and y axes using <a href="XYChart.swapXY.htm">XYChart.swapXY</a>. Now the x-axis is from bottom to top and is on the left of the chart, while the y-axis is from left to right and is at the bottom of the chart.<br><br>
<li> Use <a href="XYChart.setYAxisOnRight.htm">XYChart.setYAxisOnRight</a> to move the y-axis to the opposite side of the plot area, so that the y-axis is on the top of the plot area (instead of at the bottom). (<b>Note:</b> setYAxisOnRight moves the primary y-axis to the opposite side. It is the right side by default, but will become the top side if x and y axes are swapped. The name of this method is for compatibility with earlier versions of ChartDirector in which <a href="XYChart.swapXY.htm">XYChart.swapXY</a> was not supported.)<br><br>
<li> Use <a href="Axis.setReverse.htm">Axis.setReverse</a> to reverse the direction of the x-axis, so that the x-axis is from top to bottom (instead of bottom to top).</ul>
For demo purposes, this example uses <a href="RanTable.htm">RanTable</a> to simulate a database table with 4 columns, in which one is a date/time column and the remaining three are data columns. The date/time column is passed to ChartDirector as the x values using <a href="Layer.setXData.htm">Layer.setXData</a>, while the data columns are passed to ChartDirector as y values using <a href="Layer.addDataSet.htm">Layer.addDataSet</a>.
