Set the text labels to be used on the axis.<br><br>
This method is typically used to set the x-axis to enumerated scale. In enumerated scale, the data points are associated with the x-axis by position. The first data point will be plotted at the first label position on the x-axis, the second data point at the second label position, and so on.<br><br>
Enumerated axis is a very flexible axis type. It is most suitable for chart types where the data points are evenly spaced on the x-axis. The axis labels can be any text. They do not need to be numbers or dates. If they are numbers or dates, you can format them in any way you like before calling this method.<br><br>
Internally, ChartDirector will assign a value of 0 to the first axis label, 1 to the second axis label, and so on. These values are not visible. Only the axis labels are visible. However, these values may be useful for some ChartDirector features that need to reference the axis position by value, such as adding mark lines using <a href="Axis.addMark.htm">Axis.addMark</a>.<br><br>
By default, all axis labels will be associated major ticks. If you want to associate a label with a minor tick, use '-' as the first character of the label. If you want to draw the label without a tick at all, use '~' as the first character of the label. The '-' and '~' are special characters and will not appear on the actual label. They just tell ChartDirector that the label should be associated with a minor tick and no tick at all.<br><br>
If you have a label that begins with '-' or '~', and you do not want it to be interpreted as special characters, add '\' as the first character of the label.<br><br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to skip some labels (e.g. draw one label per five data points). If you want to draw a major tick without any labels, use a space character " " as the label. If you want to draw a minor tick without any labels, use "-" as the label. If you want to leave a label position empty without a tick or a label, use an empty string.
