This section describes how to install ChartDirector for PHP under Windows.
For the Linux, FreeBSD or Solaris version, please refer to
<a href="#unixinstall">Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris Installation</a>.
</div><p class="heading2">PHP Version Compatibility on Windows</p><div class="content">
ChartDirector for PHP on Windows requires at least PHP versions 4.0.4pl1,
and has been tested up to PHP Ver 4.3.1 (the latest PHP release as of the
date of this document).
</div><p class="heading2">Installing ChartDirector for PHP on Windows</p><div class="content">
ChartDirector for PHP on Windows is distributed as a zip file. To install
ChartDirector:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Unzip the ChartDirector distribution.
<br><br>
<li>The ChartDirector for PHP module and its supporting DLLs are in the
"ChartDirector\lib" subdirectory. Copy all files in the "ChartDirector\lib"
subdirectory to the PHP extension directory in your system.
<br><br>
<table cellpadding="15"><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC">
The PHP extension directory is determined by the "extension_dir"
variable in your PHP configuration file. The PHP configuration file
is usually called "php.ini" and is in the [windows] directory.
<br><br>
If you are not sure where is your PHP configuration file, create a web
page with just one line:
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left:25"><xmp><?php echo phpinfo() ?></xmp></div>
<br>
Then access this page with your browser. It will tell you the file name and
location of your PHP configuration file.
<br><br>
If the "extension_dir" variable is configured as a relative path name, please
make sure you know where it is relative to (it depends on how your PHP is
compiled, the web server you are using, etc). To avoid confusion, you may want
to modify "extension_dir" to an absolute path name.
</td></tr></table>
<br>
<li>
ChartDirector will dynamically load the ChartDirector PHP extension when
needed. However, in some PHP systems, dynamic loading of extensions may be
disabled. If this is the case, you would need to edit your "php.ini" file
to configure PHP to pre-load ChartDirector on start up.
<br><br>
The followings are two common cases in which dynamic loading of PHP
extensions is disable:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Your PHP system may be configured to run in "safe mode" or with "enable_dl
= Off" (configured in the PHP configuration file). In these cases, dynamic
loading of extensions is disabled.
<br><br>
<li>For PHP running as a web server module (eg. Apache module or ISAPI, as
opposed to CGI) on Windows, dynamic loading of extensions is usually disabled.
It is because PHP web server modules on Windows are usually multi-threaded, and
PHP does not support dynamic loading of extensions in multi-thread web server
modules.
</ul>
<br>
If your system cannot use dynamic loading of PHP extensions, you would need
to add one of the following line to your PHP configuration file ("php.ini")
to pre-load ChartDirector on start up.
<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th>PHP Version</th><th>Statement</th></tr>

If you are running PHP as a web server module, you would need to restart the web

</div><p class="heading2">Installing Sample Programs on Windows</p><div class="content">
ChartDirector for PHP comes with a number of sample PHP scripts under
the "ChartDirector\phpdemo" directory. They are good examples and tutorials
on how to use ChartDirector.
<br><br>
You may run these sample scripts to verify that ChartDirector is correctly
installed.
<br><br>
To view the sample PHP scripts, simply copy them to your web server
directory. Then access the "index.php" page using a browser.
<br><br>
If ChartDirector is installed correctly, you should see sample charts
being generated by the sample PHP programs as you click through the
links in the "index.php" page.
<br><br>
If for some reason, you cannot see the charts, please click on the
"check installation" link on the "index.php" page. This will show the
error messages, which may be useful to diagnose the problem.
</div><p class="heading2">Installing ChartDirector License on Windows</p><div class="content">
If you have purchased a license to use ChartDirector, you should have a license
code delivered to you via email and postal mail.
<br><br>
To install the license code, follow the steps below:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Save the license code in an ASCII text file, and name the file "chartdir.lic".
The ASCII text file should contain just one line, which is the license code. A
sample license file is available at
<a href="http://www.advsofteng.com/chartdir.lic">http://www.advsofteng.com/chartdir.lic</a>
for your reference.
<br><br>
<li>Put the license file in the same directory as "chartdir.dll", which should
be in your PHP extension directory.
<br><br>
<li>Make sure the web server "anonymous user" has sufficient privileges to read
the license file.
</ul>
</div><p class="heading2">Using ChartDirector for PHP on Windows</p><div class="content">
Any PHP script that uses ChartDirector need to include the ChartDirector script
"phpchartdir.php". Please copy the "phpchartdir.php" (located in the
"ChartDirector\lib" subdirectory) to your PHP scripts directory. In your PHP
scripts, please include the following statement:
<br><br>
<div style="margin-left:25"><xmp>require_once("phpchartdir.php");</xmp></div>
<br>
You may also put the "phpchartdir.php" in other subdirectory. In this case, you
need to include the path name in the "require_once" statement. Please refer to
the PHP documentation for details on how to use "require_once".
