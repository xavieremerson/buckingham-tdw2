<div class="content">
All ChartDirector database sample codes described in this
documentation are based on a MySQL database. The sample codes are provided for
reference purposes. To actually run the sample codes, you would need to set up
your database system as follows:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Verify that your PHP has MySQL extensions installed
<br><br>
<li>Set up a MySQL server to run on the same machine as the web server
<br><br>
<li>Create a database called "sample" in your MySQL server
<br><br>
<li>Create an account with username "test" and password "test" that can be used
to access "sample".
<br><br>
<li>Import the table "sample.sql" (located in the "phpdemo" subdirectory) into
the "sample" database
</ul>
The sample database that
contains only one table called "Revenue". The table stores the monthly revenue
data for three business units - Hardware, Software and Services. It contains
four columns as follows:
<br><br>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><th>Column Name</th><th>Type</th></tr>
<tr><td>TimeStamp</td><td>Date/Time</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hardware</td><td>Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>Software</td><td>Number</td></tr>
<tr><td>Services</td><td>Number</td></tr>
</table><br>
Each row in the database table contains monthly revenues for the business units,
where the date is stored in the "TimeStamp" column. The sample database contains
rows from Jan 1990 to Dec 2001.
