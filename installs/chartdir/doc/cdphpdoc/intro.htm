<p class="heading2">Welcome to ChartDirector</p>
<div class="content">
ChartDirector is a powerful chart component for creating professional looking
charts for web and windows applications. Key features include:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Fast and Efficient :</font></b>
ChartDirector is specially designed to handle the demanding requirements of
server side usage. It multi-threaded design handles multiple concurrent requests
quickly and efficiently.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Flexibility :</font></b>
ChartDirector's object oriented API allows you to control and customize chart details,
providing you with tremendously flexibility to design the charts you want.
<br><br>
ChartDirector even includes a general purpose graphics API, so you can add annotations,
custom text, shapes and images to decorating your charts the chart in custom ways. It
is possible to use ChartDirector as a general-purpose graphics library.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Comprehensive Chart Styles :</font></b>
Include pie, bar, line, spline, step-line, trending, curve-fitting, inter-line coloring,
area, scatter, bubble, box-whisker, HLOC, candlestick, simple gantt, radar, polar line,
polar area, polar spline, polar scatter, polar bubble.
<br><br>
In additional, all chart styles support XY axis swapping. For example, bar charts can be
horizontal or vertical, and the same applies to line charts, area charts, etc. Many chart
styles also support 3D effects.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Layer Architecture :</font></b>
Enables new chart styles to be composed easily using chart layers as building blocks. For
example, a line chart with error symbols can be composed easily using a line layer and a
box-whisker layer. With alpha transparency support, bottom layers remain visible even if
hidden by top layers.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">CDML :</font></b>
The innovative ChartDirector Mark Up Language (CDML) technology allows rich formatting
of text with embedding icons and images. CDML is supported in all ChartDirector text
positions, including chart titles, legend keys, axis labels, data labels, etc.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Advanced Color System :</font></b>
In addition to ARGB colors, all objects in ChartDirector can use dynamic colors
- colors that change based on position. Colors can change abruptly at certain
boundarys (zone and threshold colors), gradually (gradient and metallic colors),
or periodically (pattern colors).
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Bandwidth Efficient :</font></b>
Optimized color reduction algorithm for creating palette based charts that looks
as good as true color charts, but with much smaller file size. Ensures fast
Internet download.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Interactive :</font></b>
ChartDirector can generate image maps for various chart objects, so charts become
interactive. Ideal for "drill-down" capabilities, "tool tip" help messages, "onMouseOver"
event handlers, or adding hypertext links or buttons to charts.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Easy to use :</font></b>
Producing charts requires just a few lines of code. ChartDirector comes with
comprehensive documenation and numerous sample programs that can be used as
program templates.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Browser Friendly :</font></b>
Produces charts in PNG, JPEG, BMP, WBMP and GIF, which are viewable in virtually
all browsers, including those in mobile phones and electronic organizers. Charts
can be imported to email or word documents. No Java or ActiveX control required.
<br><br>
<li><b><font color="#C02020">Internationalization :</font></b>
Unicode characters support. Configurable number and date/time formats.
</ul>
