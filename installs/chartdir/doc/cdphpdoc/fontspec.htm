<p class="heading1">Font Specification</p>
<hr class="separator">
<p class="heading2a">Font File</p>
<div class="content">
In ChartDirector, a font can be specified by specifying the file name that
contains the font. For example, under the Windows platform, the "Arial"
font is specified as "arial.ttf", while the "Arial Bold" font is specified
as "arialbd.ttf".
<br><br>
ChartDirector also supports several special keywords for specifying the
fonts indirectly. The actual font file name is looked up from a font
table based on the keywords. The keywords are as follows:
<br><br>
<table width="98%" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tr><th width="19%">Keywords</th><th width="79%">Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>
"normal"
</td><td>
This default normal font, which is the same as the first font in the font table.
ChartDirector will draw text using this font unless otherwise specified.
</td></tr><tr><td>
"bold"
</td><td>
The default bold font, which is the same as the second font in the font table.
</td></tr><tr><td>
"italic"
</td><td>
The default italic font, which is the same as the third font in the font table.
</td></tr><tr><td>
"boldItalic"
</td><td>
The default bold-italic font, which is the same as the fourth font in the font table.
</td></tr><tr><td>
"font{N}"
</td><td>
The (N + 1)th font in the font table (the first font is "font0").
</td></tr></table><br>
The default font table contains 4 fonts. They are "arial.ttf" for "normal",
"arialbd.ttf" for "bold", "ariali.ttf" for "italic" and "arialbi.ttf" for
"boldItalic". The font table can be modified using <a href="BaseChart.setFontTable.htm">BaseChart.setFontTable</a>
or <a href="DrawArea.setFontTable.htm">DrawArea.setFontTable</a>.
<br><br>
The advantages of using fonts in the font table is that you can defined and
modified all fonts in your chart in one place.
<br><br>
ChartDirector on Windows does not come with any font files. It relies on the
operating system's font files in the "%systemroot%\Fonts" directory, where
%systemroot% is the operating system installation directory. To see
what fonts are installed in your operating system and their file names, use the
File Explorer to view that directory.
<br><br>
ChartDirector on Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris assumes the fonts files are in the
"fonts" directory under the directory where the ChartDirector shared object
"libchartdir.so" is installed. ChartDirector on Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris comes
with a number of font files in the "fonts" directory.
<br><br>
To keep the download size small, ChartDirector on Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris only
comes with some commonly used fonts. You may donwload additional fonts from the
Internet. In particular, the Microsoft fonts at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34153&release_id=105355">
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=34153&release_id=105355</a>
is highly recommended. Please refer to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq8.htm">
http://www.microsoft.com/typography/faq/faq8.htm</a> on how you could use the fonts
legally in your system.
<br><br>
ChartDirector supports True Type fonts (.ttf), Type 1 fonts (.pfa and .pfb),
Windows bitmap fonts (.fon), and Portable Compiled Fonts (.pcf fonts). The PCF
fonts are supported on Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris only, while the other fonts types
are supported on both Windows and Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris.
<br><br>
If you want ChartDirector to search other directories for the font files, you
may list the directories in an environment variable called "FONTPATH".
<br><br>
If you specify an absolute path name for the font file, ChartDirector will use
the absolute path name and will not search other directories.
</div>
<p class="heading2">Font Index</p>
<div class="content">
In practice, most font files contain only one font. However, in theory, a font
file may contain more than one font. In this case, the font index can be used to
specify which font to use.
<br><br>
By default, the font index is 0, which means the first font in the font file
will be used.
</div>
<p class="heading2">Font Size, Font Height and Font Width</p>
<div class="content">
The font size decides how big a font will appear in the image. The font size is
expressed in a font unit called points. This is the same unit used in common
word processors.
<br><br>
When you specify a font size, both the font height and font width will be scaled
by the same factor. ChartDirector also supports using different point sizes for
font height and font width to create special effects. For example,
<a href="TextBox.setFontSize.htm">TextBox.setFontSize</a> allows you to specify different font height and font width.
</div>
<p class="heading2">Font Color</p>
<div class="content">
This is the color to draw the font. (See <a href="colorspec.htm">Color Specification</a> on how colors are represented in ChartDirector.)
</div>
<p class="heading2">Font Angle</p>
<div class="content">
This is the angle in degrees by which the font should be rotated anti-clockwise.
</div>
<p class="heading2">Vertical Layout</p>
<div class="content">
By default, text are laid out horizontally, with characters being drawn from left
to right.
<br><br>
ChartDirector also supports vertical layout, with characters being drawn from
top to bottom. For example, you may use <a href="BaseChart.addText.htm">BaseChart.addText</a> to add text that are
laid out vertically. Vertical layout is common for oriental languages such as
Chinese, Japanese and Korean.
