<div class="content">
To draw charts, you need to supply data. In ChartDirector, data are supplied
as an array of numbers.
<br><br>
In many cases, a data point will be missing. For example, suppose you are
drawing a line chart with one data point per hour. It is possible that due to
various reasons, some data points could be missing. However, if you are using an
enumerated x-axis (see <a href="Axis.setLabels.htm">Axis.setLabels</a>), you cannot not simply remove that
point, otherwise the remaining points will all be shifted.
<br><br>
To address this kind of issues, ChartDirector supports a special constant called
<b>NoValue</b>, which is equal to <b>1.7E+308</b>. When ChartDirector sees that
a data point is <b>NoValue</b>, it will jump over that point.
<br><br>
In a line chart, if a data point is <b>NoValue</b>, ChartDirector will jump over
to the next data point. ChartDirector can use an alternative line color when
jumping over a <b>NoValue</b> point to visually reflect that there is a missing
point. The default alternative line color is <a href="colorspec.htm#argb">Transparent</a>, which means the
<b>NoValue</b> point will result in a discontinuous line. You may use
<a href="LineLayer.setGapColor.htm">LineLayer.setGapColor</a> to change it to other colors, such as using <a href="colorspec.htm#palette">SameAsMainColor</a>
(same color as the normal line) or a dash line color.
