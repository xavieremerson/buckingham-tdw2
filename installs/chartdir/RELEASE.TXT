                     Enhancements Since Ver 3.0 
*********************************************************************

ChartDirector Mark Up Language
==============================
Text labels in ChartDirector can now be encoded with the ChartDirector 
Mark Up Language (CDML). CDML is a simple language similar to HTML. It 
allows text to be marked up with special tags, so that a text can 
contain multiple fonts of various sizes and colors, with images and 
icons embedded, etc. 

Anti-Alias
==========
All chart types now support anti-alias. The anti-alias mode for text 
and graphics can be independently configured. 

Multi-Chart
===========
A new chart type that acts as a container for other charts. Useful for 
combining several charts in a single chart image, such as when 
creating complex financial charts. 

Polar/Radar Chart
=================
A new chart type for supporting polar/radar charts. Supports line, 
spline, area, and spline area layers. Data points can be labeled with 
text and be represented with data symbols of variable sizes (polar 
scatter and bubble charts). 

Variable Depth/Height Pie Chart
===============================
A pie chart in which the 3D depth or height of the sectors are 
variable and controlled by another data series. Each sector can have a 
different 3D depth or height. 

Sector Explode Group
====================
Multiple sectors in a pie chart can now explode as a group. In normal 
sector explosion, each exploded sector will become a separate piece. 
In a grouped sector explosion, the sectors in the group (the sectors 
must be adjacent to each others) will remain in one piece. 

Spline Line Layer
=================
A new XYChart layer which uses spline curves with configurable tension 
to join the data points.

Step Line Layer
===============
A new XYChart layer which uses step lines to join the data points. 

InterLine Layer
===============
A new XYChart layer which can be used to fill the region between any 
two lines from line layers, spline line layers, step line layers, 
trend line layers, or axis marks. Different colors can be used 
depending on which line is on top. 

Box-Whisker Layer
=================
A new XYChart layer which represents data as box-whisker symbols or 
its subset (such as just a box or just a whisker line). For example, a 
simple gantt chart can be created by using just the box part of the 
symbol. 

Variable Symbol Size (Bubble Chart)
===================================
The data symbol sizes can now be controlled by another data series. 
Each symbol can have a different size. The horizontal and vertical 
symbol sizes can be independently controllable. This feature can be 
used to create zones around data points. If circles are used as data 
symbols, the chart is becomes a bubble chart. 

Percentage Bar Layer
====================
A new data combine method in which the data sets are scaled so that 
each stacked position is sum to 100. 

Percentage Area Layer
=====================
A new data combine method in which the data sets are scaled so that 
each stacked position is sum to 100. 

Mutli-Stacked Bar Layer
=======================
A bar chart type combining the multi-bar style with the stacked bar 
style. It creates stacked bars that can be clustered into groups. 

Touching Bars
=============
A special constant to allow the bars to touch each others so that they 
shared a single border. 

Auto Hide Data Labels
=====================
For stacked bar and area charts, if a stack segment is too small, 
there may be insufficient space for the data labels. In previous 
version of ChartDirector, the data labels will overflow to adjacent 
stack segments. Now it is possible to automatically hide the data 
labels if there is insufficient space. 

Confidence and Prediction Band
==============================
The trend line layer now supports confidence and prediction bands 
around the trend. These bands represents the confidence interval of 
the trend line and the data points. For example, a 95% confidence band 
means there is 95% probability that the "real" trend line is in the 
band. 

Trend Layer Parameters
======================
The trend line layer now supports querying of linear regression 
parameters, including slope, intercept, correlation coefficient and 
standard error. 

Plot Area Clipping
==================
ChartDirector can now clip the plot area to avoid drawing outside the 
plot area even if the axis scale is insufficient to cover the data 
points. (This will not occur in auto-scaling but can occur if the axis 
scale is chosen manually.) 

X and Y Zone Colors
===================
In previous version of ChartDirector, zones of different colors can be 
defined on the plot area background to represent data ranges. It is 
now possible to define the zones as a dynamic color, and use this 
color to draw the chart. For example, if a zone color is used to draw 
a line or fill an area, the line or area will have different colors 
depending on the data values represented by the pixel coordinates. 

XY Axis Swapping
================
All XY Chart layers now support XY axis swapping. For example, it is 
now possible to draw a stacked area chart in which the area stacked 
from left to right (instead of bottom to top). 

Axis Reversal Support
=====================
Both X and Y axes can now reverse in direction. For example, instead 
of pointing from bottom to top, the vertical y-axis can now point from 
top to bottom. 

Auto-Scaling Support for X-Axis
===============================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, only the y-axis has auto-
scaling. Now both x and y axes supports auto-scaling. 

True Date/Time Axis Scale
=========================
Both x and y axes can now support true date/time scale, in addition to 
linear, log and enumeration scales. 

Major and Minor Ticks and Grid Lines
====================================
Both x and y axes can now support major and minor tick and grid lines, 
with independent style control. 

Axis Querying
=============
In previous version of ChartDirector, if auto-scaling is used, it is 
difficult to obtain the axis automatically determined axis range. Now 
special APIs are provided to obtain these information. 

Extra Field Support
===================
ChartDirector now supports user defined fields in labels, image maps, 
etc. For example, you may add icons as extra fields to labels, or add 
hidden id fields for the data points to be used in image maps. 

Parameter Substitution
======================
The parameter substituion mechanism has been expanded to include more 
variables. Examples include percentages and accumulated percentages 
for stacked charts, and user defined fields for labels and image maps. 

Output to Session Varaibles
===========================
[ASP/COM/VB, .NET and PHP editions only] ChartDirector now has a 
special method to simply outputting chart images to session variables. 

Output to Temporay File with Garbage Collection
===============================================
[ASP/COM/VB, .NET, Perl and Python editions only] ChartDirector now 
supports output to a temporary file in a given directory. 
ChartDirector will automatically create a unique temporary file name. 
It will also automatically remove temporary files older than a certain 
period to avoid accumulation of files. 

Output to OLE IPicture Interface (VB Picture/Image Controls)
============================================================
[ASP/COM/VB edition only] ChartDirector now supports output to an 
object with an OLE IPicture interface. The OLE IPicture interface is 
the interface used by Visual Basic Picture and Image Controls. So the 
chart image can be displayed directly by these controls without going 
through intermediate files. 

Output to .NET Image Objects
============================
[.NET edition only] ChartDirector now supports output to a .NET Image 
object. This allows ChartDirector charts to be displayed in .NET 
Windows Forms easily using standard PictureBox controls.

Output to BMP
=============
ChartDirector now supports outputting the BMP images in addition to 
PNG, alternative GIF, JPEG and WBMP. 

Optimized Color Reduction Algorithm
===================================
ChartDirector now supports an optimized color reduction algorithm for 
reducing the number of colors in a chart to 256, with very little loss 
in chart quality that is hardly visible to the human eye. The charts, 
however, will be much smaller in file size because palette mode 
formats can be used instead of true color formats. This is most useful 
for Internet applications with bandwidth efficiency concerns. 

Data Manipulation Utilities
===========================
Provides many data manipulation functions operating on arrays, such as 
array add, subtract, multiply, divide, computing moving averages, 
moving standard deviations, moving correlations, filtering, shifting, 
inserting, etc. Useful for creating financial indicators. 

Random Table Utilities
======================
A utility to generate a table with random numbers to simulate a 
database table. This is intended for demonstration and testing 
purposes. 

Database Table Utility
======================
[ASP/COM/VB and .NET editions only] A utility to read from a database 
table, and retrieve its rows and columns as arrays for use with 
ChartDirector. 

Font Table
==========
ChartDirector now supports specified fonts as an index to a font 
table. The default fonts are also specified in the font table. This 
feature allows all fonts in a chart to be configued in one place. This 
also facilitates internationalization by changing the default fonts to 
fonts that contain international characters. 

Default Number Formatting and Date/Time Representation
======================================================
By default, ChartDirector uses "dot" as the decimal point, and use 
English for dates that needs to be specified in textual form (eg. 
"Sun", "Mon", "Tue", ... and "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" ....). These default 
settings are configurable to facilitate internationalization. 

Low Level Image Manipulation
============================
The low level graphics API now supports many more graphics operation, 
such as resizing, rotating, and various transformations (affinity 
transform, wave transform, etc), with configurable resampling filters. 

*********************************************************************
                       Changes Since Ver 2.5
*********************************************************************

Anti-Alias
==========
ChartDirector Ver 3.0 by default creates charts with anti-alias shapes 
and text. Previous versions of ChartDirector only uses anti-alias in 
text. 

Anti-alias produces charts of much higher quality. For pie, line and 
area charts in PNG image formats, the image size in bytes may become 
larger. It is because anti-alias may increase the number of colors 
significantly for these types of charts. A chart that originally can 
be saved in palette mode may now need true color mode. This increases 
image size. 

If larger image size is of a concern, it can be addressed by using the 
optimized color reduction algorithm (see below). Another option is to 
disable anti-alias for shapes by using the BaseChart.setAntiAlias 
method. 

Optimized Color Reduction Algorithm 
===================================
In previous version of ChartDirector, if an image is to be converted 
to 256 colors, a standard "web-safe palette" is used. The web-safe 
palette is designed to be optimal for very old browsers (eg. Netscape 
1.x/2.x browsers) on 256 color computers. Dithering is then used to 
approximate a color by mixing pixels from the web-safe palette. 
Dithering may introduce "dot patterns" on the image. 

In ChartDirector Ver 3.0, the default color reduction algorithm is 
enhanced to use an optimized color palette generated dynamically based 
on the image. Because the color palette is optimal, no dithering is 
needed. The image created will be very close to the original image, 
with disortions hardly visible to the human eye. 

Unless you are using very old browsers on 256 color displays, the new 
algorithm should produce images with much higher quality. 

The old algorithm is still available by using the 
DrawArea.setPaletteMode method. 

Auto-scaling Margins 
====================
In previous versions of ChartDirector, auto-scaling will try to use 
the maximum possible region in the plot area to plot charts. As a 
result, the data representation may touch the top or bottom edges of 
the plot area. 

In ChartDirector Ver 3.0, by default there will be a 10% margin. As a 
result, the axis scale chosen by ChartDirector Ver 3.0 may be slightly 
different from the scale chosen by previous versions of ChartDirector. 

The auto-scaling margins can be configured with the Axis.setAutoScale 
method. 

X-Axis setLinearScale 
=====================
In previous version of ChartDirector, if the "setLinearScale" method 
of the XAxis object is used without specifying any tick increment, the 
x-axis will have no tick. 

In ChartDirector Ver 3.0, if you use "setLinearScale" without 
specifying any tick increment, the ticks will be automatically 
determined. This is to make the "setLinearScale" methods of the x-axis 
and y-axis behave in a consistent manner. (In ChartDirector Ver 3.0, 
the x and y axes are symmetrical and unified into a single Axis 
object.) 

*********************************************************************
                       Upgrade Considerations
*********************************************************************

Code Compatibility
==================
ChartDirector Ver 3.0 is designed to be code compatible with all 
previous versions of ChartDirector. That means all source code should 
run without modification. 

Link Compatibility
==================
For compiled programming languages that needs to link to ChartDirector 
at compile time, it may be necessary to recompile and/or relink the 
programs. 

For C++, the programs need to recompile using the updated headers and 
relink to "chartdir30.dll" (instead of "chartdir25.dll" or other 
earlier versions of ChartDirector DLL). 

For ASP.NET programs in code-behind style or for .NET Windows Forms 
programs, the programs need to recompile with the updated 
ChartDirector assemblies. 

For Visual Basic programs, if they access ChartDirector.API using late 
binding (that is, using CreateObject), there is no need to recompile 
the programs. Note that all sample codes and documentation that come 
with ChartDirector use late binding. If your code uses the same method 
as the examples, there should be no need to recompile your programs. 

On the other hand, if a Visual Basic program access ChartDirector 
using early binding (that is, using "New ChartDirector.API"), it is 
necessary to recompile the program with the updated ChartDirector 
component. 

Behavioural Compatibility
=========================
The charts produced by ChartDirector Ver 3.0 could be slightly 
different from the charts produced by earlier versions of 
ChartDirector using the same source code. Please refer to "Changes 
Since Ver 2.5" for details. 

License Compatibility
=====================
Advanced Software Engineering's licensing policy is that all 
commercial software licenses will be entitled to free upgrade for the 
next version of the software, and thereafter, free upgrade for another 
12 months. 

Therefore, all existing ChartDirector Ver 1.x and Ver 2.x licenses are 
still valid for ChartDirector Ver 3.0. The license code is compatible 
and does not need to change. 

Upgrade Procedure
=================
If you are using ChartDirector with Microsoft IIS, before the upgrade, 
you would need to stop the "IIS Admin" service first using the Service 
Control Panel. It is because IIS may lock up several ChartDirector 
files, preventing the upgrade. Stopping IIS using the "Internet 
Services Manager" or stopping the "World Wide Web Publishing" service 
is not sufficient, as it does not actually stop IIS. 

To upgrade ChartDirector, simply install the new version on top of the 
old version. 

For the ASP/COM/VB and .NET editions of ChartDirector, the setup 
program will uninstall the existing ChartDirector before installing 
the new version. 

For the PHP/Perl/Python editions of ChartDirector, please remember to 
update the files "phpchartdir.php", "perlchartdir.pm" and 
"pychartdir.py". These files may have been copied to the various 
scripting directories in your computer. It is impossible to use the 
old versions of these files with the new version of ChartDirector. 

For PHP running on Apache servers, you may need to restart the Apache 
servers for the updated ChartDirector to take effect.
