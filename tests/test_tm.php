<p>We've all seen dialog boxes that look like the picture on the right.</p>

<p>Dialog boxes are bad enough: they pop-up at inconvenient times, they derail our train of thought, and normally we don't even read them. But this type of dialog box is worse. It's not even a dialog box. It's <i>monolog</i> box. There's nothing one can do with this messages but click "OK". Or wait and click "OK". They have, as I've explained before, <a href="http://www.humanized.com/weblog/2006/07/22/know_when_to_stop_designing_quantitatively/">0% efficiency</a>. Beyond that, monolog boxes can have frightening consequences: because I often use two monitors, I've spent panicked seconds thinking I'd lost my work due to a crash&#0133; only to discover later that a monolog box had appeared on the other screen and stopped Word from operating normally. Even with a single monitor, you can miss the dialog box, and you'll have a similar scare.</p>
        
		<p>In the article <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/06/14/629189.aspx">The Spelling Check is Complete</a> by Jensen Harris (of the Microsoft Office User Experience team) defends the "Word has finished spell check" monolog box shown above, along with the "Word has finished searching your document"  box. The Office team had tried removing those documents but discovered that "people who were spell checking their document manually had no idea when the process was complete." Thus, the monolog boxes were reinstated.</p>

<p>This is classic inside-the-box thinking. The problem is valid: people have trouble knowing the process is complete. But the solution isn't to use monolog boxes. I can think of two different&mdash;and better&mdash;solutions. You can probably think of more.</p>

<p><strong>Solution 1: Bypass the problem</strong></p>

<p>Implied in the justification for reinstating the monolog boxes is the false idea that spell check is a fundamentally modal operation. In Jensen's words:</p>

<p>"Spell check is one of those great features that have a beginning, a middle, and an end. The beginning is you clicking the spell check button. The middle is the computer conversing with you about potential misspelled words and giving you an opportunity to fix them. And the end is the computer telling you that the process is complete."</p>

<p>But Spell check isn't necessarily a modal interaction at all. Word's own spell-check-as-you-type feature is a great example of a non-modal spell check. The text is underlined with a red squiggle: you only need to "converse" with the computer if you decide to fix it. The Gmail spell check, although ever-so-slightly modal, is another example of a spell check that does not require a "conversation": spell check is done when <i>you</i> are done. Besides obviating monolog boxes, non-modal spell check has another benefit: it isn't mutually exclusive with writing. If you are correcting a misspelling and you see something else you'd like to change, you can do it without exiting spell check. Your <a href="http://humanized.com/about/#rule5">train of thought</a> is never endangered&mdash;let's see the standard Word spell checker and it's monolog box do that!</p>

<p><strong>Solution 2: Think outside the (dialog) box</strong></p>

<p>If you keep Word's somewhat antiquated spell check mechanism, then it's true that the user needs to be informed when Word has finished spell checking. As I've explained, a modal monolog boxes are dangerous and inhumane. Luckily, there are many other methods of presenting information that are not modal. In particular there is one we are using in Enso, our upcoming product: transparent messages.</p>

<p>Transparent messages are the brainchild of <a href="http://www.jefraskin.com">Jef Raskin</a>. It's simply a large and translucent message that's displayed over the contents of your screen. They fade away when the user takes any action (like typing or moving the mouse). In practice, the message is both noticeable yet unobtrusive. And because the message is transparent, you can see what's beneath it. It's just humane. Take a look:</p>

<p><object width="425" height="350"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/XcHjA5uwHM8"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/XcHjA5uwHM8" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="350"></embed></object></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Message Log</strong></p>

<p>Transparent messages, however, introduce a problem: messages disappear easily. What happens if the user wants to see what it said? The solution is message log&mdash;simply a list of past messages. This way if the user doesn't have time to read a message, they can go to the message log to view it only if they think it is important enough. And think about it: a message log would be a great thing to have anyway. How many times have you wanted to reference the contents of a dialog box and couldn't because you had already dismissed it? And how many times have you had to transcribe the contents of a dialog box because the text wasn't selectable? The lives of users and the lives of tech support staff would be greatly simplified by the addition of a system-wide message log.</p>

<p><strong>On the web</strong></p>

<p>The transparent message also has a place on the web. Web designers have a constant struggle to come up with non-obtrusive means of conveying fleeting feedback to users. For example, validating user input and checking login credentials. It is in instances like this that the transparent message really shines. Give it a try below.</p>

<p>The correct email is <b>trans@parent.com</b> and the correct password is <b>pass</b>. Make sure to play with incorrect login information.<br />
<script>function validate(){ email = $("email").value; pass  = $("pass").value; if( email == "" ){ alert( "Please enter an email address." ); return false; } if( email != "trans@parent.com" ){ alert( "Unknown Email Address" ); return false; } if( pass == ""){ alert( "Please enter a password." ); return false; } if( pass != "pass" ){ alert( "Invalid password." ); return false; } alert( "Thank you for logging in!" ); return false;}</script><br />
<form action="#"><br />
    <div class="col-two"><br/><b>Email</b> <br/> <input type="text" id="email" /></div><br />
    <div class="col-two"><b>Password</b> <br/> <input type="password" id="pass" /></div><br />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" onclick="validate();return false;"/><br />
</form></p>

<p><br />
Feel free to nab the <a href="/js/TransparentMessage.js">source code</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Transparent messages are a simple and elegant solution to a problem that is normally either over-looked or over-engineered. They're not right for everything, but for messages that need no user interaction, transparent messages are hard to beat: they have an efficiency of 100%.</p>

<p>Plus, they look pretty.</p>

    		<p>I very much like your demonstration, but I would say you need a certain tollerence on the mousemove, so it doesn't fade until a significant move. This would decrease the percentage of times the user accidently dismisses it because they accidently jogged the mouse.</p>

<p>I agree with this post alot, toasts are a very good was of conveying information to the user in a non-workflow destructive manner.</p>

    		<p>ICR: Thanks to the fade effect, large text, and short messages, the user would have to be near-blind to miss them, even if they moved their mouse immediately after clicking Login (which is actually rare as I have observed, because the user waits for something to happen, <i>then</i> moves the mouse).</p>

<p>And if you just use the keyboard like I do, it won't go away until you correct the text or move the mouse to browse after you hit Enter.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I dig the post. Well done, Aza.</p>

    		<p>Whoa... That is ... disconcerting.  I'm like a little hamster trained to click "ok".  When the message popped up, I didn't know what to do.    I couldn't deal with the message itself by clicking the "okay I see you please go away now."  If I hit "enter" in the sense of "okay, I got it", the same message pops up, since Enter essentially resubmits the form.  Instead, I had to *keep going*, move something else completely unrelated to the message box.<br />
My little hamster brain has developed a way of dealing with pop-up messages that is inhumane, so now humane-ness is scary.  But then again, habitualization is one of those human things, right?</p>

    		<p>Chris: Our transparent messages were conceived and developed independently of Growl. That said, Growl is a wonderful idea and looks great.</p>

<p>Sushu: You make a good point. I am reminded of when I started using Windows and kept right clicking to make the context-menu go away, thereby making it reappear over and over again. The problem was that the dismissal gesture had been overloaded with the do-it gesture. The same problem applies here. It can be solved by making sure a fading transparent message cannot be replaced with the same transparent message. I've implemented that, so give it a try.</p>

<p>User testing, as always, rules the day. Thanks for pointing out the problem!</p>

    		<p>On the subject of the evils of dialog boxes, I'd recommend Alan Cooper's <i>About Face</i> for those who haven't read it.</p>

<p>I really like the HTML-enabled <b>Live comment preview</b>. Thanks very much! </p>

<p>I'm not sure if it's appropriate to comment here on the design of the blog design itself, but the font used in the body of the post could be a little bit darker (for my taste). The lower contrast is especially noticeable on my screen when text is <i>italicized</i>. The palette of grays and colors has a pleasant Tufte-ness about it, though.</p>

    		<p>cold wolf: actually, i have to agree with [ICR] on this and i would encourage you to observe the mouse move threshold for message dismissal, when a tablet is the user's input device. i find that even with a reasonably steady hand, the message is dismissed as the stylus rebounds from the tablet surface - the sub-pixel accuracy at play no doubt...</p>

    		<p>ICR predicted exactly what I did.</p>

<p>I clicked the button and immediately moved the mouse.  I was still focussed on the login box closer to the bottom of the screen when a flash of green appeared in my peripheral vision.  By the time I glanced at it it had already disappeared.</p>

<p>People move the mouse for lots of reasons.  Often when I initiate a process like logging in I immediately swap to another application while I wait for the process to complete.  In this case I was just twitchy: I moved over the button, clicked, and moved away without thinking.  Some people have palsies.</p>

<p>This is a cool idea but it does need to be tuned carefully.  Aza, take a look at Office 2007's Floatie/MiniBar concept, which starts very transparent and becomes more solid the more you move towards it.  The Office team reportedly spent a lot of time tuning the "shyness" of it.</p>

<p>Usability testing will also tell you a lot about how people react to this.</p>

<p>Also, it's important to connect the transparent message to the message log, otherwise people won't know where to look when the message goes away.  Having the message "genie" into the taskbar icon for the message log would be one way to do this.</p>

<p>Interesting ideas that, I think, will come to fruition before long.</p>

Also, I was thinking, if there are more than one error messages on the form, how will this work.<br />
I would prefer a message that would go after a certain period of time (which can be determined by the reading speed of users)</p>

    		<p>I like this idea and will consider transparent messages in future. In cases where you still want something a bit more affirmative, like a proper confirmation I would want these to be presented in a way that blends with the transparent messages though. Of course these are two different things, and on screen they should look different, but they are related in someway and shouldn't look completely alien to each other. Could be tricky. But great post! Thanks.</p>

<p>Oh and sorry for being slow, but how do I get to your blog homepage without the back button or editing my address bar?(!!!) The logo at the top isn't clickable... I feel confused and second-class now.</p>

<p>2. In IE6 if the User/Pass text boxes are near the bottom of the browser window, then for some reason the message is displayed and immediately disappears. If the user/pass texrt boxes are in the center of the browser window, the message stays around until you move the mouse.</p>

    		<p>I have to say, I agree with those few who miss the messages. This technique is brilliant for short little happy messages like "You are now logged in" but for messages that tell the user something is wrong or tell the user they have something they need to do, it can be a pain. </p>

<p>I wonder if a good compromise would be to all the user to click on any part of the dialog box instead of having to aim at an "OK" button?</p>

I don't have a screen reader to try it out, but is definitely a concern of mine. I like the idea of the article though. We need to move beyond the old limitations of the user interface and take advantage of new techniques that can provide a better user experience.</p>

i tried the javascript file and found its not working . first bug was , its says , addLoadEvent is not defined,  i found following trick on some site : <br />
function addLoadEvent(func) {<br />
  var oldonload = window.onload;<br />
  if (typeof window.onload != 'function') {<br />
    window.onload = func;<br />
  } else {<br />
    window.onload = function() {<br />
      if (oldonload) {<br />
        oldonload();<br />
      }<br />
      func();<br />
    }<br />
  }<br />
}<br />
, but then it says, function DIV is not defined . <br />
Can you guys please put a valid js file so that ppl can use it without problems... </p>

    		<p>I hacked together a jQuery implementation of this, using the excellent Thickbox as a base. I've added a few things to it, including "Delay" and "Tolerance" settings. </p>

<p>"Tolerance" - won't trigger dismissal of the Monolog unless the mouse is moved XX pixels (5 is my default).  "Delay" does what it sounds like - there's a slight delay after mouse move before starting the fade-out. I've also made the "Escape" key trigger an immediate dismissal.</p>

    		<p>The principle is nice and useful in certain circumstances, but the example is really flawed!</p>

<p>I think you need to make a distinction between location based user input (the form visible on the screen) and abstract user input (a menu command executed by a short-cut).</p>

<p>Whenever the user needs to get feedback on the login-form, the preferable place is around the form itself. In this case, using over-the-top feedback, the background of the login form should turn red and a big text message should be placed above or under the form itself, becoming a permanent part of the page until the user hits 'Submit' again. The message can be used as a reference of what was wrong (the username or the password).</p>

<p>In case of the spelling check, accessed by a keyboard shortcut instead of the check spelling subwindow, it might make sense to place the message on a 'random' location.<br />
On the other hand, a much more logical approach would be to visualize the process. Which means that at the start of the spelling check something would be shown over the document itself displaying the progress, that turns into a dialogue in case an error is found. If no errors are found at all it might behave like the transparent message. In either way, the user knows the spelling check is finished because the 'progress' lay-over is gone.</p>

    		<p>Neither monolog boxes, or transparent messages are better. One requires more actions to dismiss the other requires less. One is easy to easy to not pay attention to, and the other is really easy to not pay attention to, depending on the situation.</p>

<p>Monolog boxes require more actions, and are thus more demanding, but will still become a habit, as Susha has reminded us. The function of having an OK button is to make sure that the user has payed attention to it, but this actually isn't true because we could "OK" the message without understanding it. The solution would be to provide two 'actions' for habit formation: One action would mean "I understand it, now get rid of it", and the other action being, "I don't care about this right now, save it for later".</p>

<p>Monolog boxes that appear after finishing a document, are a friendly reassurance that the entire document has been spell checked, thus to avoid the user checking the document multiple times, like someone with OCD.... I will gladly click on OK, like I gladly cross off a to do item on my to do list. Although... I should be able to tell I have reached the end of the spell check because I have reached the end of the document or selection, and I'd rather have the CHOICE to cross it off my todo list item.</p>

<p>The most dramatic example of a monolog box with a bully-attitude, is in Photoshop (i'm using CS1) where upon attempting to make a selection, and no selection is possible, a monolog box appears requiring you to say "ok", where it is fairly implicit that no selection is made. This can happen repeatedly several times a minute. A transparent message that disappears on mouse movement would be better, in this context, but no message at all would be best, we can tell without a system message. :)</p>

<p>Going back to the monolog box that appears after finishing a spell check... It is a reassurance that the entire document has been spell checked... which could give a false confidence in that the document is without spelling flaws. While this is false. The message should say, "While the spell check is complete, it is recommend that you check to make sure that he computer did not make errors." Thus the message is honest about the it's own limited intelligence. It's harder to get mad at something that admits it own shortcomings.</p>

    		<p>I am willing to ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, and ok again a monolog box, as long as my computer is doing something really exciting.</p>

<p>I would be will to ok, ok, and ok again, an interface that simplifies creating dynamic websites, and simplifies all the different profiles I have to fill out on all the social community websites. And simplifies all the of the various email accounts I have created.</p>

<p>Seeing the larger picture is the most pressing matter. It is what everyone is drawn to about the internet. It's the same thing that draws people to religion.</p>

<p>What is also interesting is looking at how many people are playing massive online role playing games, why are they "wasting" all that time, what are they gaining? Respect, a community, love, and self-actualization? Some people have focused so intensely on playing WoW they have forgotten about their physiological needs, and died. Imagine if politicians exhibited this level of focus!</p>

<p>You know what is also frustrating is that your comment system is not as good as the system that is used on <a href="http://digg.com." rel="nofollow">http://digg.com.</a></p>

I have to agree with John: this is a non-problem. As a matter of fact, the 'spell-checker-misses-misspelled-words-that-are -actually-words' syndrome makes a wonderful point: When you're spell-checking, you *should* be paying attention.
</p>
<p>
You say that the 'monolog' box breaks your train of thought, but the only situation I can imagine where you'd:
<ol>
<li>start a spell check</li>
<li>wander to some other window</li>
<li>be annoyed by the monolog box eventually interrupting you</li>
</ol>
would be if you manually started a spell-check knowing that everything was spelled right, and that would be little more than a pathetic plea for praise, wouldn't it?
</p>
<p>
However, a deeper issue does still exist... those little red squiggly lines tell us that words are potentially misspelled, but scrolling completely through a 200 page document to check for red squiggles is hardly efficient. Clicking 'spellcheck' every time you want to know how you're doing is just a faster method of the same inappropriate method - iterating through every word in the document.
</p>
<p>
You say to think outside the box... how about getting rid of the box altogether? These boxes, whether modal or transparent, walk a fine line between distracting our attention and not getting our attention well enough.
</p>
<p>
My first thought is to have some sort of passive 'spelling error status indicator' somewhere... perhaps a macro that uses the SpellingErrors property and the CommandBarControls collection to display an icon on the toolbar - red if there are errors, blue if there are none?

    		<p>Ok the article islong and I haven't had the time to read all the previous comments (my lunch time will be over in 2 minutes), so forgive me if I'm preaching to the choir, but I just have two suggestions to make:</p>

<p>1. Give the warnings a delay before fading out (this one I know to have been mentioned before). My first reaction after typing something is always to go back to the mouse (perhaps to get rid of monolog boxes as quickly as possible), so the messages disappeared as soon as I touched the mouse, hardly giving me any time to read.</p>

<p>2. Give imediate focus back to the fields, with the previous input selected, so I can just type again, instead of having to select the text again so I can type one more time. If it's possible to narrow down what the exact error was (email or password), then give me the specific message ("the password you provided is invalid") and focus on the appropriate input.</p>

<p>I can't stress how perfect this would be. If anyone's made those points before, take this as a reinforcement.</p>

    		<p>Hi,</p>

<p>When working with the HP3000 with a language called PROTOS, back in the 80's it had a very nice command called:  "message".</p>

<p>As a programmer you just call a procedure for example like this:  message("Finished Spellcheck"), and it would display that message in a specially dedicated line, like a Status Bar at the bottom of the screen.  The message would appear there, maybe with a beep and/or a background color change and just sit there.  No fade away, no button to press to dismiss.</p>

<p>It was perfect!  No need to log, even it is a good idea, no problems with accidental fade aways.  The user knows that that  line is for messages and knows where to look them.</p>

<p>It was unobtrusive, no need to do it transparent.  Even a transparent message can be intrusive.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Sp</p>
