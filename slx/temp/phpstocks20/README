PHP Stocks Version 2.0b (beta)
-----------------------------

What is it ?
------------
PHP Stocks is a program that one can use on their webpage to get stock quotes from Yahoo Finance.
Currently it is capable of:
		1. Basic View
		2. Detailed View

It is based on the Finance::Quote perl which is currently maintained by Paul Fenwick <pjf@cpan.org>
http://finance-quote.sourceforge.net/
*note from Paul* Dj Padzensky's, deserves all the credit for writing the original Finance::YahooQuote.


TODO
----
1. Add customizability features.. (portfolio manager etc)..
2. Generate graphs just like the ones you see on yahoo (no rush :o) )   
3. Defeat the RIAA in their quest to rid the world of mp3s. :).

REQUIREMENTS
------------
1. These aren't rigid requirements.. just the environment in which I've tested and it works.

	- PHP 4.X (http://www.php.net)
    - Smarty Templating Engine (http://smarty.php.net)
