																			<td>3:10 pm - Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL)  stock fell more than 7%, its biggest daily decline since January 2013, after the iPhone maker released disappointing earnings outlook. The firm said it expects revenue to be in a range of $42 billion to $44 billion for the current quarter, below analyst estimates of $46.12 billion, according to FactSet. Apple reported that it earned $14.50 a share in the fiscal first quarter, compared with $13.81 a year earlier. Revenue rose to $57.59 billion from $54.51 billion during the same period. Apple also said it sold 51 million iPhones in the quarter, up from 47.8 million a year ago. However, given the fanfare that had greeted the launch of the iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s in late 2013, many had expected iPhone sales of as much as 55 million to 56 million units. "We expect shares of overweight-rated Apple to be under pressure in the near term. IPhone units were light, and the guidance for the March-quarter implies continued softness, alongside higher [operating expense]. We think the iPhone air pockets reflect broader slowing in the smartphone market and company-specific factors," Mark Moskowitz, an analyst at J.P. Morgan, said in a note. Even comments from Carl Icahn that he bought an additional $500 million worth of Apple shares did not help to revive the stock. </td>
