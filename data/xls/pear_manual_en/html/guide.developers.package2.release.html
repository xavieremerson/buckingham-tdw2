>Documenting release type</H2
><P
>&#13;   In package.xml 1.0, there was one release type.  package.xml 2.0 provides much finer
   control over the kind of release in order to provide three new release types: extension
   binary release, extension source release, and package bundle release.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   All of the normal release tags (phprelease, extsrcrelease, extbinrelease) may contain
   two optional sections, &#60;installconditions&#62; and &#60;filelist&#62;.  The purpose of these
   sections is to allow specification of different file install groups based on the target OS
   for installation, or other common install conditions.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   To be clear: in package.xml, there was 1 &#60;release&#62; tag.  package.xml 2.0 allows
   several adjacent release tags, each specifying a different install set.  This actually
   simplifies complex installation filesets by separating the contents listing of the tarball
   from how the installer should manipulate this listing.  Debugging installation file sets
   should be much simpler with this change.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The &#60;filelist&#62; tag can contain only two possible tags, &#60;install&#62; and &#60;ignore&#62;.
   install has two required attributes, "name" and "as".  The install tag is used
   in the same manner as package.xml's install-as attribute for the &#60;file&#62;, to specify a new
   installation location for a file in the contents list.  The ignore tag is used to completely
   ignore a file.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The &#60;installconditions&#62; tag can contain 4 tags whose format can be found in the
   &#60;dependencies&#62; section: &#60;php&#62;, &#60;extension&#62;, &#60;os&#62;, and &#60;arch&#62;.
   Each tag can appear exactly once except for the extension tag, which can appear limitless times.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The php tag is used to specify a php version or range of versions that an install set should
   be valid with.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The extension tag is used to specify extensions that must be present for an install set to
   be valid.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The os tag is used to specify an OS that must be present for an install set to be valid.  Note
   that unix can be used to match all flavors, and linux can be used to match all linux-based OSes.
   Darwin should be used for Mac OS X, and * can be used to match all operating systems.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The arch tag is used to specify a uname string or portion of a uname string that must match
   in order for the install set to be valid.

    distribute a complete application as one tarball, or to distribute a library of packages in a
    single tarball.
