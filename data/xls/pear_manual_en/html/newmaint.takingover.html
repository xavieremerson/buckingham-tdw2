>&#13;    If you want to become the new lead maintainer of a package that
    is marked as unmaintained on the <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR
    website</A
>, the following section will explain to you the
    necessary steps for this to happen.
  </P

><P
>&#13;        The first thing is to inform the <A
HREF="mailto:pear-qa@lists.php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR Quality Assurance mailing
        list</A
> about your intention.  If you have not been
        involved in PEAR prior to that, it is a good idea to write a few
        words about you and your motivations.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        The QA team will then state whether you can take over the
        package or not, eventually explaining why.  You can then <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/account-request.php"
TARGET="_top"
>apply for an account</A
> for
        the PEAR website unless you already have one.  The PEAR Group
        will have to grant this account, and afterwards the QA team will
        assign you as the new lead maintainer for the package.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        If the sources of the package are kept in the PHP CVS
        repository, you will also need an account for this.  You can
        sign up for it on the <A
HREF="http://www.php.net/cvs-php.php"
TARGET="_top"
>PHP
        website</A
>.  Please mention in the purpose field of the
        request form that the PEAR QA team has told you to get an
        account, so that your request can be processed faster.  CVS
        accounts are managed by the PHP Group, so PEAR unfortunately has
        only limited influence on this process.

          In case you already have a CVS account for
          <TT
CLASS="literal"
>cvs.php.net</TT
>, it is only necessary for you
          to get additional <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"karma"</SPAN
> for the module where
          the package resides.  You can request this karma by sending an
          email to the <A
HREF="mailto:pear-group@php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR
          Group</A
>.  (Please also mention in this mail that you
          have already talked to the QA team.)
