>&#13;     The code in PEAR is partitioned in
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"packages"</SPAN
>.  Each package
     is a separate project with its own development team, version
     number, release cycle, documentation and a defined relation to
     other packages (including dependencies).  Packages are
     distributed as gzipped tar files with a description file inside,
     and installed on your local system using the PEAR installer.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     There are two types of packages: source packages (containing
     source files only), and binary packages (containing
     platform-specific binary files, and possible source files).
     Installing source packages with C code obviously requires a C
     build environment.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     PEAR defines a package tree, where each
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"node"</SPAN
> in the tree is
     represented by a part of the package name.  The nodes are
     organized by simple descriptive topics, and each part is
     separated by an underscore.  Examples of package names are
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"MP3_Id"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Archive_Tar"</SPAN
>
     and <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP_Post"</SPAN
>.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Packages may relate to each other through explicit dependencies,
     but there is no automatic relation between for example a package
     and its <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"parent"</SPAN
> in the package tree
     (for example, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP_Post"</SPAN
> is
     by default independent of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP"</SPAN
>).
    </P
><P
>&#13;     A few top-level nodes in the package tree called
     <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"sub-repositories"</SPAN
> have special functions,
     currently these are
     <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-pecl"
>PECL</A
> and <A
HREF="introduction.html#about-gtk"
>Gtk</A

     rules apply, see more in the description of each sub-repository
     below.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     A style guide, the <A
HREF="standards.html"
>PEAR Coding
     Standards</A
> (short PCS), exists to ease collaboration
     between PEAR developers, to help quality and portability, and to
     help PEAR contributors to provide consistent-looking-and-feeling
