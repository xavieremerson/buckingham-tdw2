>&#13;    Working on the translations is not just translating an English file 
    and commiting the results. Much of the work is needed to update 
    the already translated ones, to get in sync with the content of 
    the English files. To follow the modifications in the English tree, 
    you should <A
HREF="mailto:pear-doc-subscribe@lists.php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>subscribe to the PEAR
     documentation mailing list</A
>
    to get CVS commit messages, or read the archives. If you never update your
    files, the translations can get useless.  
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Updating a foreign language file can get difficult, as you may not 
    know when and who translated that file, so you may not know where 
    you should look for the updates needed. We have one system 
    for tracking the revisions and modification dates of the files in <TT
CLASS="literal"
>peardoc</TT
>.

NAME="faq.translators.revcheck-comments">The Revision Comments</H2
><P
>&#13;     Instead of storing all responsibilities in a central file, the revision
     comment system stores them in the files they provide information about. 
     Information about translator, revision numbers, and status information 
     is stored in the revision comment. 
     Let's see what would be in the header of the example file 
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>bookinfo.xml</TT
> file in this case: 
     <TABLE
WIDTH="100%"
CELLSPACING="0"

><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#60;!-- EN-Revision: 1.16 Maintainer: jane Status: ready --&#62;</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
   </P
><P
>&#13;     We can see the revision number for the last english file used to 
     update the translation (EN-Revision: 1.16), the translator cvs account 
     name.
     But we can also add some other status information in the case it is 
     needed (eg. "partial" for incomplete translations). This revision
     comment system is basically about storing the information in
     the XML files, and not in a central place. This is extremely
     convenient now, as there are more than 2400 files in the
     English tree.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Currently, all three fields (English revision, Maintainer, Status)
     are needed. Maintainer is intended to be a CVS user name, or some
     nickname without a space, status can be anything without a space.
     Note, that this header is not updated by CVS (in contrast with 
     <TT
CLASS="literal"
>$Revision</TT
>, which is updated automatically).
     This is only updated when you edit the contents of the comment
     yourself.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     You may see this as a good thing, but using these comments,
     you lose the quick look on the whole list of your
     files. 
     No, you do not lose this, but get much more! 
     If you would like to build a full list of you files, you
     can go to the /peardoc/ directory and run:
     <TABLE
WIDTH="100%"
CELLSPACING="0"
CELLPADDING="0"
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>./scripts/revcheck_pear.php xx &#62; revcheck.html</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
     Here <TT
CLASS="literal"
>xx</TT
> is the imaginary language code.
     After running this script you'll get a
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>revcheck.html</TT
> in the same directory.
     You can find revision comparisions and links to diffs
     for all the files in this language. 
     You can also add a further restriction parameter, the maintainer name,
     so the script will only list the files corresponding to
     the given maintainer. 
    </P
><P
>&#13;     There are some optional extensions introduced for this script,
     to be available in this generated HTML page. 
     This is why the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>translation.xml</TT
> files are
     introduced. 
     Here comes a simple <TT
CLASS="filename"
>translation.xml</TT
> file
     for the imaginary xx language :
     <TABLE

&#60;translation&#62;

 &#60;intro&#62;
  This is some introductory text for the xx language translators
  about who is the manager of the translation, and where to find
  more information. This paragraph is printed on the top of the
  generated revcheck.html page.

     In this file, you can add users without a CVS account, and can
     assign ready documents or work-in-progress files to them. 
     The biggest advantage of using this addon is that all this information
     is used to generate dynamic tables of translators and files in
     the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>revcheck.html</TT
> file. 
     All translators are linked to from the individual files they are assigned
     to, and there is a nice table showing the state of files for
     all the translators. 
     Assigning ready files may be needed if a time consuming update is 
     in progress on that file.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     There are two optional parameters you can add to a &#60;file&#62;,
     if you would like to record it: the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>date</TT
>
     and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>revision</TT
>. 
     Date is assumed to be the date when the work was started, revision 
     is the checked out revision of the English file used to start the work 
     (denoted as CO-Revision in the generated table). 
     There is currently no fixed format for the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>date</TT
> 
     parameter.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     Another addon to this system is just to give credit to all people
     who worked on one file, and not just the current maintainer. To achieve
     this goal, we added the credit comments. One credit comment in
     eg. <TT
CLASS="filename"
>history.xml</TT
> may look like this (in case
     Joe Doe translated the file initially, but Jane followed him to
     be the maintainer):
     <TABLE
WIDTH="100%"
CELLSPACING="0"
CELLPADDING="0"
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#EEEEEE"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#60;!-- CREDITS: joedoe --&#62;</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
     The credits comment can contain a comma-separated list. These
     comments only affect the display of the translators table in
     <TT
CLASS="filename"
>revcheck.html</TT
>.
