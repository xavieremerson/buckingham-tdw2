>&#13;    The source code of PEAR packages are read by thousands
    of people. Also, it is likely other people will become
    developers on your package at some point in the future.
    Therefore, it is important to make life easier for
    everyone by formatting the code and docblocks in
    standardized ways. People can then quickly find the
    information they are looking for because it is in the
    expected location. Your cooperation is appreciated.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Each docblock in the example contains many details about writing
    Docblock Comments.
    Following those instructions is important for two reasons.
    First, when docblocks are easy to read, users and developers can quickly
    ascertain what your code does.
    Second, the PEAR website now contains the phpDocumentor generated
    documentation for each release of each package, so keeping things straight
    here means the API docs on the website will be useful.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Please take note of the vertical and horizontal spacing.
    They are part of the standard.

/**
 * An example of how to write code to PEAR's standards
 *
 * Docblock comments start with "/**" at the top.  Notice how the "/"
 * lines up with the normal indenting and the asterisks on subsequent rows
 * are in line with the first asterisk.  The last line of comment text
 * should be immediately followed on the next line by the closing asterisk
 * and slash and then the item you are commenting on should be on the next
 * line below that.  Don't add extra lines.  Please put a blank line
 * between paragraphs as well as between the end of the description and
 * the start of the @tags.  Wrap comments before 80 columns in order to
 * ease readability for a wide variety of users.
 *
 * Docblocks can only be used for programming constructs which allow them
 * (classes, properties, methods, defines, includes, globals).  See the
 * phpDocumentor documentation for more information.
 * http://phpdoc.org/docs/HTMLSmartyConverter/default/phpDocumentor/tutorial_phpDocumentor.howto.pkg.html
 *
 * The Javadoc Style Guide is an excellent resource for figuring out
 * how to say what needs to be said in docblock comments.  Much of what is
 * written here is a summary of what is found there, though there are some
 * cases where what's said here overrides what is said there.
 * http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/index.html#styleguide
 *
 * The first line of any docblock is the summary.  Make them one short
 * sentence, without a period at the end.  Summaries for classes, properties
 * and constants should omit the subject and simply state the object,
 * because they are describing things rather than actions or behaviors.
 *
 * Below are the tags commonly used for classes. @category through @access
 * are required.  The remainder should only be used when necessary.
 * Please use them in the order they appear here.  phpDocumentor has
 * several other tags available, feel free to use them.
 *
 * @category   CategoryName
 * @package    PackageName
 * @author     Original Author &#60;author@example.com&#62;
 * @author     Another Author &#60;another@example.com&#62;

     *
     * Summaries for methods should use 3rd person declarative rather
     * than 2nd person imperative, begining with a verb phrase.
     *
     * Summaries should add description beyond the method's name. The
     * best method names are "self-documenting", meaning they tell you
     * basically what the method does.  If the summary merely repeats
     * the method name in sentence form, it is not providing more
     * information.
     *
     * Summary Examples:
     *   + Sets the label              (preferred)
     *   + Set the label               (avoid)
     *   + This method sets the label  (avoid)
     *
     * Below are the tags commonly used for methods.  A @param tag is
     * required for each parameter the method has.  The @return and
     * @access tags are mandatory.  The @throws tag is required if the
     * method uses exceptions.  @static is required if the method can
     * be called statically.  The remainder should only be used when
     * necessary.  Please use them in the order they appear here.
     * phpDocumentor has several other tags available, feel free to use
     * them.
     *
     * The @param tag contains the data type, then the parameter's
     * name, followed by a description.  By convention, the first noun in
     * the description is the data type of the parameter.  Articles like
     * "a", "an", and  "the" can precede the noun.  The descriptions
     * should start with a phrase.  If further description is necessary,
     * follow with sentences.  Having two spaces between the name and the
     * description aids readability.
     *
     * When writing a phrase, do not capitalize and do not end with a
     * period:
     *   + the string to be tested
     *
     * When writing a phrase followed by a sentence, do not capitalize the
     * phrase, but end it with a period to distinguish it from the start
     * of the next sentence:
     *   + the string to be tested. Must use UTF-8 encoding.
     *
     * Return tags should contain the data type then a description of
     * the data returned.  The data type can be any of PHP's data types
     * (int, float, bool, string, array, object, resource, mixed)
     * and should contain the type primarily returned.  For example, if
     * a method returns an object when things work correctly but false
     * when an error happens, say 'object' rather than 'mixed.'  Use
     * 'void' if nothing is returned.
     *
     * Here's an example of how to format examples:
     * &#60;code&#62;
     * require_once 'Net/Sample.php';
     *
     * $s = new Net_Sample();
     * if (PEAR::isError($s)) {
     *     echo $s-&#62;getMessage() . "\n";
     * }
     * &#60;/code&#62;
     *
     * Here is an example for non-php example or sample:
     * &#60;samp&#62;
     * pear install net_sample
     * &#60;/samp&#62;
     *
     * @param string $arg1  the string to quote
     * @param int    $arg2  an integer of how many problems happened.
     *                       Indent to the description's starting point
     *                       for long ones.
     *
     * @return int  the integer of the set mode used. FALSE if foo
     *               foo could not be set.
     * @throws exceptionclass  [description]
     *
     * @access public
     * @static
     * @see Net_Sample::$foo, Net_Other::someMethod()
     * @since Method available since Release 1.2.0
