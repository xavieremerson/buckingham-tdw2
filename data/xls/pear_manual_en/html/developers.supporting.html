     don't hesitate to contact the maintainer of the package. You can
     find out who the maintainer of a package is by browsing the     
     <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/packages.php"
TARGET="_top"
>package list</A
>
     on the PEAR website and selecting the desired package. The

     can take over this job. If you feel brave enough to answer support
     questions, fix bugs and manage release cycles, you can contact the
     previous maintainer or the 
     <A
HREF="pear-dev@lists.php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR developers mailing list</A
>
     and announce your will to maintain the package.

NAME="guide.dev.supporting.wishlists">Buying things from wishlists</H2
><P
>&#13;     For all the PEAR developers, PEAR is a project they are working
     on in their free-time, which means that they don't earn any money
     with it. If you or the company you are working for is using a
     PEAR package in one of your/their (commercial) products, you/they can
     do this for free, of course. But if you think that the author of
     the package you are using desires some credits, it would be nice
     to buy something from his wishlist at
     <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>Amazon</A
> or another
     internet store. To see if a PEAR developer has registered his
     wishlist, surf to the 
     <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/accounts.php"
TARGET="_top"
>Account information
     page</A
> and select the developer from the list there. If he
     has a wishlist, it's noted somewhere on the detail page.
