>Finding an appropriate package name</P
><P
>&#13;       One of the most important tasks while contributing a new package
       to PEAR is finding an appropriate name for your package.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       The general syntax for package names is
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>&#60;Category&#62;_&#60;Name&#62;</TT
>. The value for
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>&#60;Category&#62;</TT
> should be chosen from a
       predefined list of categories that are available in PEAR (e.g.
       <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTTP"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Net"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"HTML"</SPAN
>).
       The second part is the name of the package (like
       <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Upload"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Portscan"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Table"</SPAN
>).
      </P
><P
>&#13;       The categories that are currently available in PEAR are
       represented by the bold headings at the
       <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/packages.php"
TARGET="_top"
>Package
       Browser</A
>. If you think that your package does not fit in
       any of the existing categories, you can ask the on the mailing
       list to create a new category. (PEAR is usually reluctant to do
       that.)
      </P
><P
>&#13;       Apart from this general syntax, the package names can also contain
       more than one category name. An example for this is
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>HTML_Template_PHPLIB</TT
>: The multiple categories indicate
       that the package <TT
CLASS="literal"
>PHPLIB</TT
> is part of the category
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>Template</TT
>, that again is part of the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>HTML</TT
>
       category. This naming scheme is necessary here since it's possible
       that there are Template systems in PEAR that don't work with HTML but
       with another technology. (The cases where more than one
       <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"category"</SPAN
> is used are pretty rare.)
      </P
><P
>&#13;       If you need further advice or help for finding a name for your
       package, you should ask on the <A
HREF="mailto:pear-dev@lists.php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;       developers mailing list</A
>.
      </P
></LI

><P
>Announcing to the PEAR developers</P
><P
>&#13;       The second step while contributing is to announce your package in
       <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/pepr/"
TARGET="_top"
>PEPr</A
>.
       Usually this announcement will spawn some discussion. After one week
       you may call for votes with PEPr and the developers will then
       start to vote for or against your proposal. (You are of course
       urged to join the upcoming discussion.) Announcing a package does of
       course not mean that it is already accepted! That will still take
       some time and likely some more efforts from your side.

        The following passages are taken from the administrative
        document <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/group/docs/20040402-la.php"
TARGET="_top"
>Handling
        Package Proposals</A
>, which describes proposing new
        packages in more details. Reading this document should be a
        mandatory step for PEAR newbies.

>&#13;       Only the votes of active members of the PEAR community (must have
       a PEAR web account, however the proposer himself is not counted)
       are counted, however anyone may vote. Votes require that a final
       choiceof package name is specified.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       The votes are added up, which means that one -1 offsets a
       +1. However -1 vote should always be considered to be serious and
       may lead to decisions being made on a case by case basis by the
       <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/group/"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR Group</A
> who reserves a
       veto (it is intended that in the future the PEAR QA team will
       assist the PEAR Group in such situations). Therefore a -1 vote
       *must* contain a comment explaining that decision, it is
       desirable that votes in favour (+1) should also be accompanied
       with an explanation when appropriate.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       A vote is accepted if the total of all votes exceeds +5.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       In case the proposal is not accepted the package can be further
       discussed on the list and the proposer may attempt to make
       another "call for vote" (it is expected that this is only done
       for sensible reasons).

>&#13;       Getting the necessary accounts

>&#13;       Right now one can distinguish between two types of accounts
       related to PEAR:

       <P

><OL
TYPE="a"
><LI
><P
>Pear.php.net account</P
><P
>&#13;          This account is always necessary for you, if you want to release
          your package through PEAR. With this account you have access
          to the necessary infrastructure on
          <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>pear.php.net</A
> in order
          to propose, upload and roll new releases. The PEAR Group manages
          PEAR accounts and pearweb karma levels (i.e.: karma to
          use the web site to maintain packages).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>PHP CVS account</P
><P
>&#13;          If you want to administrate your code via
          <A
HREF="http://www.cvshome.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>CVS</A
> , you can also
          apply for a CVS account to have access to the pear
          <SPAN
CLASS="abbrev"
>CVS</SPAN
> module on <A
HREF="http://cvs.php.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;          cvs.php.net</A
>. This makes it easier for other users
          to contribute to your code. The PHP Group (group@php.net) manage
          the PHP CVS server, which is used for maintaining PEAR packages.
          If you already have a PHP CVS account you will ask the
          PEAR Group for Karma for a given package or set of packages.
          Please send an email to <A
HREF="mailto:pear-group@php.net"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;          pear-group@php.net</A
> specifying what packages you need
          commit access along with credentials (e.g.: the package "lead"
          email giving you his go or a QA member email announcing you are
          to be given access).
         </P
><P
>&#13;          If you already have a CVS repository somewhere else (e.g. on
          <A
HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/"
TARGET="_top"
>SourceForge</A
>),
          or if you don't want to maintain your code via CVS, you don't
          need the PHP CVS account.  It is highly recommended to use some kind
          of public repository, so that users can try out any
          bug fixes you apply to the code, before a new release is
          rolled.

>Registering the package</P
><P
>&#13;       Once you successfully went through the contribution procedure and
       got your pear.php.net account, you finish with registering your
       package. Registering does not mean that you are going to release
       a first version of your package. It just means that some basic
       information about the package will be added to the PEAR package
       database.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       The registration process is quite straightforward: Fill out the
       form on <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/package-new.php"
TARGET="_top"
>this site</A
> and
       submit the information. After you have done that, the <A
HREF="http://pear.php.net/group/"
TARGET="_top"
>PEAR Group</A
> has to finally approve
       your submission. This usually happens in a few hours and you will
       be notified about it via email.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       After having registered your package, you can create a first
       release, which is described <A
HREF="developers.release.html"
>here</A
>.
