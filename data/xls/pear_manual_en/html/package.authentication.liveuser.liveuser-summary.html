>LiveUser and LiveUser_Admin</H2
><P
>&#13;    LiveUser is an advanced authentication and permission framework that comes 
    with a large array of out of the box features which can be used optionally.
      
    LiveUser is split in two packages. 
   
    The base package is called LiveUser and is often refered to as the "client" 
    and is what will be commonly be used to authenticate a specific user 
    and then optionally make permission checks on this user. 
   
    The other is the LiveUser_Admin package which provides various ways to 
    manage all relevant data, like users, groups/roles, rights 
    and their relations.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    LiveUser provides the following key features:
   
    The LiveUser class takes care of the login process and can be configured to 
    use a certain permission container and one or more different 
    auth containers.
   
    That means, you can have your users' data scattered amongst many data 
    containers and have the LiveUser class try each defined container until 
    the user is found.
   
    For example, you can have all website users who can apply for a new account 
    online on the webserver's local database. 
   
    Also, you want to enable all your company's employees to login to the site 
    without the need to create new accounts for all of  them. 
   
    To achieve that, a second container can be defined to be used by the 
    LiveUser class.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    You can also define a permission container of your choice that will manage 
    the rights for each user. 
   
    Depending on the container, you can implement any kind of permission schemes
    for your application while having one consistent API.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Using different permission and auth containers, 
    it's easily possible to integrate newly written applications with older ones 
    that have their own ways of storing permissions and user data. 
    
    Just make a new container type and you're ready to go!
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Currently available are containers using:
    PEAR::DB, PEAR::MDB, PEAR::MDB2, PEAR::XML_Tree and PEAR::Auth.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    LiveUser_Admin provides the following key features
    You'll be able to add/edit/delete/get things like:

>&#13;    At this point LiveUser is still in beta stage. 
   
    Even so LiveUser is already being used 
    on a wide range of production websites.

>&#13;    A detailed introduction to the core concepts of LiveUser can be found 
    in the following phpmag article:
    <A

>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    This article was published in april 2004 and is therefore not entirely 
    uptodate.
    
    However the core principles remain unchanged and most of the recent changes 
    resolve around making the API more consistent and flexible. 
    
    As a result the API examples are mostly out of date. 
    
    The article also fails to mention the fact that the permission containers 
    are now separated in a logic and a storage layer. 
    
    This was done to remove logic duplication as well as to allow the 
    implementation of a stackable storage approach, where users could configure 
    LiveUser to first call a cache storage layer, which in turn would fetch 
    the necessary data on demand from the actual storage layer.
    
    Furthermore the article also does not mention the SQL generator used in the
    LiveUser_Admin package. 
    
    This feature has made the API much more flexible since now the entire 
    storage schema is configurable and extensible. 
    
    It also means that more or less any sort of filtering can be applied with 
    on demand joining.
    
    On overview of this API can be found here:

>&#13;    A more recent article providing a step by step guide to LiveUser and the
    different permission containers can be found here:

   </P
><P
>&#13;    Before you can use LiveUser you will need to setup the necessary data 
    structures for the chosen container. 
    
    Through the use of the configuration options it is possible to customize 
    alot of the aspects of the storage layer.
    
    Most notably it is possible to alias field and table names. 
    
    This should make it possible to integrate any legacy data into LiveUser. 
    
    Depending on the container chosen you may have to use the database schema 
    installer. 
    
    The installer requires the MDB2_Schema and MDB2 packages and is able to 
    handle most configuration options properly to be able to install the 
    database schema directly into your database. 
    
    You can find the install class in "[PEAR]/data/misc/schema/install.php". 
    
    There is some sample code which is partially commented out at the top. 
    
    Basically its a two step process for both the auth and perm: (1) 
    generate the schema xml file, (2) install the schema.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    During the installation process the installer will create backup files of 
    the installed schema. 
    
    These files will enable the installer to attempt to alter the database if 
    run again with a different configuration. 
    
    However if these files exist the installer will always attempt to alter 
    instead of creating the tables from scratch as long as you are using the sam 
    DSN. 
    
    If for some reason you need to create the tables from scratch again then 
    please delete the backup files with the matching DSN. 
    
    You can find the installer inside the data directory of your pear install
    directory. 
    
    Its called install.php and at the top of the file you will find a number of
    sample API calls which are commented out.
   </P

>&#13;    An ER diagram of the database structure can be found here:
    <A
HREF="http://www.backendmedia.com/LiveUser/liveuser_db_schema.png"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.backendmedia.com/LiveUser/liveuser_db_schema.png</A
>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The diagram details what tables are needed 
    for what permission complexity level.
    
    If you want to prevent the installer from installing tables you dont need 
    you can modify the "tables" property of the instance of the permission 
    container you pass to the generateSchema() method in the installer.

>&#13;    In order to get started with LiveUser the following two articles should 
    help in getting off the ground:

>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The observer support in LiveUser allows users to automatically have LiveUser 
    call certain callbacks on a number of internal events. 
    
    It is documented here:

HREF="http://oss.backendmedia.com/LiveUser/Observers"
TARGET="_top"
>http://oss.backendmedia.com/LiveUser/Observers</A
>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Both packages also ship with a wide range of examples. 
    
    These will be installed into the "docs" directory in your PEAR install 
    directory. 
    They try to illustrate various usage scenarios.
    
    The database examples come with a schema file please see the demodata.php
    in the examples root folder of the LiveUser package for details on how to 
    install these schema files from the command line or from a browser. 
    You will once again need MDB2_Schema to be able to install the schema files.
