    organizing documentation in the <TT

    but instead with how to organize documentation logically.

>&#13;       First, every package solves a problem.  What is this problem?
       Try to figure out what assumptions your end-users might not have
       about the problem (they may not realize that this is a problem
       that needs solving). For instance, a template package solves the
       problem of both separating design from code, and separating
       business logic from display logic. If possible, explain the
       problem in terms that even a novice programmer can understand.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       Next, how does the package uniquely solve the problem?  This is
       something that most documentation lacks.  For example, there are
       many template engines.  All of them solve the same problem, but
       none of them do it in the same way.  A block-based template
       engine does not have any logic at all, whereas a template like
       Smarty defines a whole new template language.  Some template
       engines compile their templates, others don't.  What is unique
       about your package?  Can someone who has never seen the code get
       a good idea of how it solves the problem?
      </P

><P
>&#13;       Provide examples!  Start right away with simple examples that
       shows the basic feature set -- they will show users how to
       quickly start using the package.  More complex examples will help
       the users in understanding advanced ways of using the package.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       If your package exposes complex interfaces or multiple constants
       that can't be fully explained in one or two examples (which is
       very likely), do not miss to explain them thoroughly in the
       documentation. Document any interfaces that users must use, such
       as a database DSN, command-line arguments for applications,
       configuration file contents, or any other non-code element.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       Last, proofread your documentation.  If possible, have someone
       else who is not as familiar with your project take a look at the
       documentation.  They will catch assumptions that you have missed.
