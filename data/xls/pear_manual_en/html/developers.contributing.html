   for everybody to contribute code (in form of a new package or as an

   aims to keep the quality of the packages at a very high
   level. Because of that there are certain requirements for

       functionality to the codebase without breaking backwards

>&#13;       In this context it may be helpful to become familiar with the
       basics of object oriented programming. Eventhough PHP 4 does not
       come with full object oriented support yet, the knowledge will
       possibly help you in maintaining an extensible state for your
       package code. There are numerous resources about object oriented
       programming all around the web and you will also find tons of
       books available for your reading pleasure. However we can can
       recommend <A

       If you write the documentation in Docbook XML and if the markup

        As of August 2003, <A
HREF="http://www.phpdoc.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>phpDocumentor</A
>
        is fully capable of converting in-code API documentation and external
        tutorials into Docbook XML. PhpDocumentor version 1.2.2 or
        greater is required.  Install with <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pear install
        phpDocumentor</TT
>. Use the XML:DocBook/peardoc2:default
        converter on your source code to generate output.  The output
        should be generated directly into the
        <TT
CLASS="literal"
>peardoc/lang/package</TT
> directory, where lang is
        en, or fr, etc.
       </P
><P
>&#13;        Be aware though that only shipping the API documentation does
        not suffice! Additionally your package has to come with usage
        examples and (even better) tutorials about its usage. More
        information can be found in the section describing

>&#13;       All developers have experienced the frustration of bugs.  They are a fact
       of life in programming, but fortunately there are a few systems that can
       be used to catch them, kill them, and prevent their return.  Regression
       tests should be included with every stable release, so that users can
       run them if a bug occurs to help you debug the package.  Examples of
       .phpt regression tests can be found as part of the PFC

>&#13;       If you are not willing to maintain your code over a long period
       of time, it makes little sense to contribute it. PEAR is the
       standard repository of PHP packages, and this comes with great
       responsibility.  Maintaining means more than just providing
       support via the various <A

       lists</A
>:
      </P
><P
>&#13;       You must be willing to not only fix bugs, but also integrate useful
       enhancements contributed by users of your packages, if they fit the
       design specifications of your package.  You should expect to release
       new versions of your package regularly with bug fixes.  If you will be
       unable to maintain your package for an extended period of time, it is
       expected that you will announce this to the PEAR developer mailing list,
       and assign another temporary lead maintainer or publicly document the fact
       that your package is temporarily unmaintained, and the approximate date
       that users can expect to receive support and bug fixes, if possible.
