>&#13;    A rough rule of thumb is that code which solves a problem that
    exists in one or only very few projects is not convenient for
    inclusion into PEAR because most people will not benefit from it.

    cannot be included in PEAR. In the Math section we have a number of
    elaborate packages that solve different kinds of algebraic
    problems. While those problems do not occur in average applications,
    the packages are very abstract and scientific projects benefit a
    lot.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Apart from code that does not fit into PEAR because of a lack of
    abstractness, there is another type of code that currently cannot be
    contributed to PEAR: Full web applications. We do however accept developer
    tool application like phpDocumentor but not end user applications.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    Despite the fact that the "A" in PEAR stands for
    "Application" there is a simple reason why applications
    are not yet supported: Until now nobody has gotten around to make
    the infrastructure like the PEAR installer capable of handling
    packages that provide complete web applications.
