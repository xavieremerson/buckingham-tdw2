    test your applications, you will have to register as an eBay developer (which is
    free of charge). Furthermore, you will not be able to test and develop on the
    eBay site, before your application has been certified.

>&#13;    The eBay Developers Program Sandbox is a test environment that represents a "mini" eBay site.
    The Sandbox provides the most important features of the eBay site, allowing you to build and
    test your application in a non-production environment. The eBay Sandbox supports both API testing
    as well as site testing via the GUI interface.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    While developing your application, you will always be using the eBay sandbox, which can be accessed
    via web at <A
HREF="http://sandbox.ebay.com/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://sandbox.ebay.com/</A
>. This site looks and behaves
    like any eBay website you are being used to.

>&#13;       Register as an eBay user:
      </P
><P
>&#13;       In order to register as an eBay developer, you'll have to be an
       eBay user. As eBay users are valid on all international sites, it is
       sufficient if you have an eBay user id for your local eBay site, like ebay.com or
       ebay.de.
      </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;       Register as an eBay developer:
      </P

>&#13;       Next, you will have to register as an eBay developer at the
       <A
HREF="http://developer.ebay.com/DevProgram/membership/join.asp"
TARGET="_top"
>eBay developer program</A
>. This procedure
       can take some time, as they require you to enter a lot of information, so you should do
       this carefully. If you are developing an open source application using Services_Ebay, you should
       apply for an Individual license.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       After the registration has been finisehd, you will recieve three keys that you will need
       to authenticate your eBay application: DevID, AppID and CertID. You will need these keys later
       so you should save them somewhere.
      </P
></LI

><P
>&#13;       Create one or more test users:
      </P
><P
>&#13;       As the sandbox does not share any data with the eBay sites, you will have to create new users
       that you can use to add items, make transactions and give feedback. You can create as many users
       as you need for testing purposes, just use the <A
HREF="https://scgi.sandbox.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterEnterInfo&siteid=0&co_partnerid=2&usage=0&ru=default"
TARGET="_top"
>registration form</A

       in the sandbox.
      </P
><P
>&#13;       You will need a valid email address for each of your users, as well as a valid US address and telephone
       number, you can easily get on by using <A
HREF="http://www.yellowpages.com"
TARGET="_top"
>YellowPages</A
>. A credit card is
       not required, your test users will receive money from eBay they can spend in the sandbox. Of course, this is
       no real money, which has not use outside of the sandbox.

>&#13;       Validate your test users:

       the <B

>Authentication and Authorization</H2
><P
>&#13;    eBay's Auth&#38;Auth process is quite complex and can be the biggest hurdle for getting started with
    the webservice. To make an API call the following information is required:
   </P
><P
>&#13;    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>DevID (received after registration, unique per developer)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>AppID (received after registration, unique per application)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>CertID (received after registration, unique per application)</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Authentication Token, unique for each user of your application</P
></LI
></UL
>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    While you already are in possession of the first three tokens, you still need the last one
    to make an API call. If your application is used by more than one user (which is the case
    for web applications), eBay does not want your application to receive the usernames and passwords
    of your users. If a user authenticates, your application is supposed to redirect him to the
    eBay login page and pass an additional parameter (a so called RuName). The user will then enter
    his login information as he is used to on the eBay website and then authorize your application
    to make API calls on his behalf.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    After that, eBay will redirect the user back to your application and pass a unique token, which can
    be used to identify this user when your application is making API calls. This technique has several
    advantages:

><LI
><P
>Single sign-on system for eBay applications</P

><LI
><P
>When your application is hacked, no passwords are revealed</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>The user only sees the login screen he is used to.</P
></LI
></UL
>
   </P
><P
>&#13;    As this authentication procedure is quite complex and requires various API calls to function
    there is an easier way, which can be used for testing. eBay provides the so called
    <A
HREF="http://developer.ebay.com/tokentool/Credentials.aspx"
TARGET="_top"
>Single-User-Tool</A
>, an HTML-based
    tool, which creates tokens that you can use to authenticate a user. All you need to do is
    submit your DevID, AppID and CertID and select whether the token will be used in the
    sandbox or production environment.

>Getting started with Services_Ebay</H2
><P
>&#13;    Services_Ebay provides a lot of examples, which demonstrate how the API calls have to be
    used. After installing Services_Ebay, they will be located in the docs/ directory of your
    PEAR installation. In order to run the examples, you will have to supply the authentication
    credentials you received from eBay. The easiest way to do this, is to modify the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>config.php</TT

    file, which is located in the <TT
