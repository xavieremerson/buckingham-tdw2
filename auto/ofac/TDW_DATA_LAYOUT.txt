=======================================================================================

The boolean full-text search capability supports the following operators:

+ A leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in every row returned. 

- A leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any row returned. 

" A phrase that is enclosed within double quote (") characters matches only rows that contain the phrase literally, as it was typed. The full-text engine splits the phrase into words, performs a search in the FULLTEXT index for the words. Phrase searching requires only that matches contain exactly the same words as the phrase and in the same order. For example, "test phrase" matches "test, phrase"

(no operator) By default (when neither + nor - is specified) the word is optional, but the rows that contain it are rated higher. 

( ) Parentheses are used to group words into subexpressions. Parenthesized groups can be nested. 

> < These two operators are used to change a word's contribution to the relevance value that is assigned to a row. The > operator increases the contribution and the < operator decreases it. See the example below. 

~ A leading tilde acts as a negation operator, causing the word's contribution to the row relevance to be negative. It's useful for marking noise words. A row that contains such a word is rated lower than others, but is not excluded altogether, as it would be with the - operator. 

* An asterisk is the truncation operator. Unlike the other operators, it must be appended to the word.
