The following changes have occurred with respect to the Office of
Foreign Assets Control Listing of Specially Designated Nationals
and Blocked Persons since January 1, 1995:

01/10/95:      To provide further guidance to existing
prohibitions, FAC added hundreds more names to the list of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons--166 of these
are Libyan (147 variations on the names of state-owned entities
and 19 individual officials) and the rest are Iraqi (6 variations
on the names of state-owned banks and 60 variations on the names
of individual officials).  FAC updated information for certain
Iraqi individuals already listed as SDN's (as indicated at the
conclusion of the entries for today's date).  In preparation for
the release of a "delimited" SDN list, FAC also swept the SDN
list to make entries consistent with regard to "Street" rather
than "St.," "Place" rather than "Pl.," "Road" rather than "Rd.,"
"Avenue" or "Avenida" rather than "Ave."

The new entries are footnoted as follows:

"* No U.S. person may deal with any Libyan or Iraqi government
official whether his name appears on this list or not.  As a
service to the users of this list, a few of Libya's and Iraq's
highest-level government officials have been listed as SDN's of
Libya and Iraq.  This is not an exhaustive list of Libyan or
Iraqi government officials, and the absence of the name of a
Libyan or Iraqi government official from this list does not
relieve U.S. persons from the responsibility to refrain from
dealing with that official."

01/24/95:      A new Executive Order became effective
"Prohibiting Transactions with Terrorists Who Threaten to Disrupt
the Middle East Peace Process."  The Treasury Department's Office

New procedures for clearing funds transfers involving North
Korea:

U.S. financial institutions may now rely on originators or
beneficiaries of funds transfers with regard to compliance with
the sanctions against North Korea and are authorized by general
license to process the post-February 14, 1995 transfer of funds
in which North Korea or a national thereof has an interest. 
Persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction who are originators or
ultimate beneficiaries of such funds transfers, however,
including U.S. banking institutions that are themselves
originators or beneficiaries, may not initiate or receive such
transfers if the underlying transactions to which they relate are
prohibited.  Specific licenses may be issued on a case-by-case
basis to authorize the unblocking of funds that were blocked by
financial institutions pursuant to this part because of an
interest of North Korea or a national thereof, that came into the
financial institution's possession or control by wire transfer or
check remittance prior to the effective date of the general
license authorizing such activity.  Such licenses will only
authorize the return of funds to remitting parties, provided that
no funds are released to the Government of North Korea, to any
entity controlled by the Government of North Korea, to any person
located in or controlled from North Korea, or to any entity
organized under the laws of North Korea.
