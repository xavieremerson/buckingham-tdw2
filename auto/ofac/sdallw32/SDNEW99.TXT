This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice
of actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals
and other entities whose property is blocked, to assist the
public in complying with the various sanctions programs
administered by OFAC.  The latest changes may appear here prior
to their publication in the Federal Register, and it is intended
that users rely on changes indicated in this document that post-
date the most recent Federal Register publication with respect to
a particular sanctions program in the appendices to chapter V of
Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations.  Such changes reflect
official actions of OFAC, and will be reflected as soon as
practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading
"Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal Register notices with
regard to Specially Designated Nationals or blocked entities may
be published at any time.  Users are advised to check the Federal
Register and this electronic publication routinely for additional
names or other changes to the listings.  Entities and individuals
on the list are occasionally licensed by OFAC to transact
business with U.S. persons in anticipation of removal from the
list or because of foreign policy considerations in unique
circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official Federal
Register publication of a notice of removal based on the
unblocking of an entity's or individual's property is reflected
in this publication by removal from the list.  Current
information on licenses issued with regard to Specially
Designated Nationals and other blocked persons may be obtained or
verified by calling OFAC Licensing at 202/622-2480.  The
following changes have occurred with respect to the Office of
Foreign Assets Control Listing of Specially Designated Nationals
and Blocked Persons since January 1, 1999:
