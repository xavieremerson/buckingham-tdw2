The following changes have occurred with respect to the Office of
Foreign Assets Control Listing of Specially Designated Nationals
and Blocked Entities since December 7, 1993:

12/20/93:      Arab Financial Services Company (E.C.), Manama,
Bahrain was added to the list as well as three individuals as
Specially Designated Nationals of Libya.  The individuals named
were: AL KABIR, Seddigh, Manama, Bahrain and Tripoli, Libya;
GIBRIL, Mustafa Saleh, Manama, Bahrain and Tripoli, Libya; and
SHALLOUF, Farag Al Amin, Manama, Bahrain, Beirut, Lebanon, and
Istanbul, Turkey.

01/07/94:      Name changes for four Libyan banks, already SDN's,
were included on the list: BANQUE ARABE LIBYENNE NIGERIENNE POUR
LE COMMERCE EXTERIEUR ET LA DEVELOPPEMENT (a.k.a. BALINEX) in
Niger is now known as BANQUE COMMERCIALE DU NIGER (a.k.a. BCN);
BANQUE ARABE LIBYENNE MALIENNE POUR LE COMMERCE EXTERIEUR ET LE
DEVELOPPEMENT (a.k.a. BALIMA) in Mali is now known as BANQUE
COMMERCIALE DU SAHEL; BANQUE ARABE LIBYENNE ET MAURITANIENNE POUR
LE COMMERCE EXTERIEUR ET LE DEVELOPPEMENT (a.k.a. BALM) in
Mauritania is now known as CHINGUETTY BANK; and BANQUE ARABE
LIBYENNE TOGOLAISE DU COMMERCE EXTERIEUR (a.k.a. BALTEX) in Togo
is now known as SOCIETE INTERAFFRICAINE DU BANQUE.

01/27/94:      The Office of Foreign Assets Control released a
"General Notice No. 3" under the Haitian Transactions Regulations
naming 523 individual officers of the Haitian Armed Forces as
"Blocked Individuals of Haiti."  The action was based on a
determination that the Haitian Armed Forces, including officers
of all ranks, are part of the "de facto regime in Haiti or its
extra-constitutional successors."  All officers of the Haitian
military were, therefore, subject to the blocking and other
prohibitions which apply to all members of the de facto regime. 
The listing, including address and date of birth information, was
initially available under the title "HAFLIST."  All banks located
in the U.S. and U.S. banks offshore were notified to review the
individual accounts which they hold to be sure that any accounts
in the names of the specified individuals are blocked and they
were told to distribute the list to appropriate platform
personnel at the branch level, especially in locations such as
South Florida, known to be high retail banking volume areas for
Haitian officers visiting the United States.  "HAFLIST," while
still available as a separate document, was subsequently
integrated into the alphabetized Master List of SDN's
("SDNLIST.WP" and "SDNLIST.TXT").  The current master list
available on the bulletin board contains the individual Haitian
officers' names. 

02/02/94:      Arab Financial Services Company (E.C.), Manama,
Bahrain was unblocked and removed from the list.

02/03/94:      At 5:05 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, President
Clinton announced the lifting prospectively of the embargo
against Vietnam and authorized new financial, trade, and other
transactions with Vietnam and Vietnamese nationals.  Property,
including property of former Specially Designated Nationals of
Vietnam, blocked as of 5:04 p.m. E.S.T., February 3, however,
remains blocked.

03/21/94:      Bahraini addresses were removed from the listings
of three Libyan SDN's: AL KABIR, Seddigh; GIBRIL, Mustafa Saleh;
and SHALLOUF, Farag Al Amin.  Otherwise their listings remain and
remain the same.  

03/31/94:      The name "M/V IRENE OLDENDORFF" was removed from
the list of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (S&M) vessels.  The
"RAMA" and the "KUPRES" remain on the list.

04/12/94:      The Office of Foreign Assets Control has released
a "General Notice No. 4" under the Haitian Transactions
Regulations naming 27 additional individual officers of the
Haitian Armed Forces as "Blocked Individuals of Haiti."  The
action was based on a determination that the Haitian Armed
Forces, including officers of all ranks, are part of the "de
facto regime in Haiti or its extra-constitutional successors." 
As before, all officers of the Haitian military are subject to
the blocking and other prohibitions which apply to all members of
the de facto regime.  The listing, including address and date of
birth information, is initially available under the title
"HAFLIST2."  All banks located in the U.S. and U.S. banks
offshore are being notified to review the individual accounts
which they hold to be sure that any accounts in the names of the
specified individuals are blocked and they are being told to
distribute the list to appropriate platform personnel at the
branch level, especially in locations such as South Florida,
known to be high retail banking volume areas for Haitian officers
visiting the United States.  "HAFLIST2," while available as a
separate document, is also integrated into the alphabetized
Master List of SDN's ("SDNLIST").  The current master list
available on the bulletin board contains the individual Haitian
officers' names.  In addition an additional name and address has
been listed for the NATIONAL CREDIT BANK.  The additional name
is: BANQUE COMMERCIALE D'HAITI; the additional address is: Place
des Heros 21 Rue P. Quant, Port-au-Prince, Haiti.

05/04/94:      The name of IRAQ-JORDAN LAND TRANSPORT COMPANY
(a.k.a. IJLTC; a.k.a. IRAQI-JORDANIAN LAND TRANSPORT COMPANY;
a.k.a. IRAQI-JORDANIAN OVERLAND TRANSPORT COMPANY), P.O. Box
5134, 4th Circle, Jabal, Amman, Jordan was added to the list of
Specially Designated Nationals of Iraq.  The names of EAST POINT
HOLDINGS LIMITED, 8th Floor, Flat 803, 2 Arch Markarios Avenue,
Capital Centre, Nicosia, Cyprus; INPEA (OVERSEAS) LTD, 284 Arch.
Makarios III Avenue, Fortuna Bld. Block B, 2nd Floor, Limassol,
Cyprus; and J.U.B. HOLDINGS LTD, 2 Sofoulis Street, Chanteclair
Bld. Office 205, Nicosia, Cyprus were added to the listing of
Specially Designated Nationals of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.  The names of ARAB TURKISH BANK (a.k.a. ARAP TURK
BANKASI A.S.; a.k.a. ATB); LIBYA INSURANCE COMPANY; MAGHREBAN
INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMPANY (a.k.a. MITCO); SAVING AND REAL
ESTATE INVESTMENT BANK; and SOCIETE MAGHREBINE D'INVESTISSEMENT
ET DE PARTICIPATION (a.k.a. SMIP) were added to the list of

alphabetized SDN list for complete addresses.

05/18/94:      Housekeeping changes...  The names of ARMOUSH,
Ahmad and ARMOUSH, Ali, both of Jordan, who had been licensed
pending removal by FAC, have now been removed from the list of
Specially Designated Nationals of Iraq.  PETRA NAVIGATION offices
in Jordan and Egypt, which had been licensed pending removal by
FAC, have now been removed from the list of Specially Designated
Nationals of Iraq.  PETRA NAVIGATION in Iraq stays on the master
list.  PIONEER SHIPPING, LTD. in Valletta, Malta, while being
removed as an SDN of VIETNAM must remain on the master list
because it is also an SDN of CUBA.  No transactions may be
conducted with PIONEER SHIPPING and all of its assets are
blocked.

05/23/94:      Further housekeeping changes... Additional address
information was added for PIONEER SHIPPING LTD and TRAMP PIONEER
SHIPPING CO., both Specially Designated Nationals of CUBA. 
References to the vessel MOON LADY were deleted from the list of
Specially Designated Nationals of IRAQ; the current owner of the
vessel AL-ZAHRAA, the Iraqi State Enterprise for Water Transport,
has been listed for the AL-ZAHRAA.

06/02/94:      The Office of Foreign Assets Control has released
a "General Notice No. 5" under the Haitian Transactions
Regulations naming 35 additional individuals who have been
determined by the Treasury Department to be "Blocked Individuals
of Haiti."  "Blocked Individuals of Haiti" include individuals or
immediate family members of individuals who have been (1)
officers of the Haitian military (2) major participants in the
Haitian coup and in the illegal governments since then, or (3)
employed by or acting on behalf of the Haitian military.  The
listing of the 35 additional names, including date of birth
information, is initially available under the title "HAFLIST3." 
All banks located in the U.S. and U.S. banks offshore are being
notified to review the individual accounts which they hold to be
sure that any accounts in the names of the specified individuals
are blocked and they are being told to distribute the list to
appropriate platform personnel at the branch level, especially in
locations such as South Florida, known to be high retail banking
volume areas for Haitian individuals visiting the United States. 
"HAFLIST3," while available as a separate document, is also
integrated into the alphabetized Master List of SDN's
("SDNLIST").  The current master list available on the bulletin
board contains the individual's names.

06/21/94:      Very substantial changes... General Notice No. 6
for Haiti added names of 12 individuals; Special Blocking memo
for Libya added 4 companies and 7 individuals; but, most
important, new Executive Order signed by President blocked all
Haitian nationals resident in Haiti and OFAC issued explanation
of EO naming many individuals explicitly.  For data see file
SDAD0621 of today's date.  SDNLIST master file has been updated
accordingly.

06/22/94:      Haitian General Notice No. 8 adds sixteen

08/18/94:      The names of ninety (90) entities and twenty-four
(24) individuals, originally released by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control as "General Notice No. 9: Notification of Blocked
Entities and Blocked Individuals of Haiti" on August 2, 1994
pursuant to Executive Order 12922 of June 21, 1994, have been
integrated into the master SDN list as "Blocked Persons of
Haiti."  Three additional entities designated on August 18, 1994
as "Blocked Persons of Haiti" under the same Excutive Order have
also been included--SOCIETE NATIONALE D'INVESTISSEMENT S.A.
(a.k.a. SNI), UNIBANK S.A. (where correspondent accounts exist,
parallel accounts must be set up per FAC), and UNIFINANCE S.A. 
The name of Jean Georges MOURRA, previously considered a "Blocked
Person of Haiti" has been removed from the list.  A name change
has been noted for Libyan Arab Uganda Bank for Foreign Trade and
Development, which is now known as TROPICAL AFRICAN BANK LIMITED. 
A clarification has been added to the designation for PROMOBANK,
Haiti indicating where correspondent accounts exist, that
