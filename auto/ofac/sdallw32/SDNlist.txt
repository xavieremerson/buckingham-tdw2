ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS AND BLOCKED
PERSONS:

This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and
other persons whose property is blocked, to assist the public in
complying with the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC.
The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in
the Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes
indicated in this document that post-date the most recent Federal
Register publication with respect to a particular sanctions program
in the appendices to chapter V of Title 31, Code of Federal
Regulations.  Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and
will be reflected as soon as practicable in the Federal Register
under the index heading "Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal
Register notices with regard to Specially Designated Nationals or
blocked entities may be published at any time.  Users are advised
to check the Federal Register and this electronic publication
routinely for additional names or other changes to the listings.
Entities and individuals on the list are occasionally licensed by
OFAC to transact business with U.S. persons in anticipation of
removal from the list or because of foreign policy considerations
in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official
Federal Register publication of a notice of removal based on the
unblocking of an entity's or individual's property is reflected in
this publication by removal from the list.  Current information on
licenses issued with regard to Specially Designated Nationals and
other blocked persons may be obtained or verified by calling OFAC
Licensing at 202/622-2480.

On June 19, 2000, the Office of Foreign Assets Control amended the
Foreign Assets Control Regulations to implement the President's
September 17, 1999 determination to ease sanctions against North
Korea.  New financial, trade, and other transactions with North
Korea and its nationals are now authorized.  An import notification
and approval procedure is required for all imports from North
Korea.  Assets blocked prior to June 17, 2000 remain blocked unless
licensed for release.  For that reason, the following entries are
being broken out into a separate section in OFAC's SDN list.

another Executive Order--12978--on October 21, 1995, "Blocking
Assets and Prohibiting Transactions with Significant Narcotics
Traffickers;" "[SDNT]" stands for "Specially Designated Narcotics

(vessels):

Blocked vessels are being segregated into a separate section on the
Master list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. 
Banks are now instructed to reject any funds transfer referencing a
blocked vessel and must notify OFAC, via facsimile with a copy of
the payment instructions, that funds have been returned to remitter
due to the possible involvement of an SDN vessel in the underlying
transaction.  Banks must contact OFAC's Compliance Programs
Division for further instructions should the name of an SDN vessel
appear in shipping documents presented under a letter of credit or
if noticed in a documentary collection.  SDN vessels must
themselves be physically blocked should they enter U.S.
jurisdiction.  Freight forwarders and shippers may not charter,
book cargo on, or otherwise deal with SDN vessels.
