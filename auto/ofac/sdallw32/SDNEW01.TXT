This publication of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control
("OFAC") is designed as a reference tool providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and
other entities whose property is blocked, to assist the public in
complying with the various sanctions programs administered by OFAC. 
The latest changes may appear here prior to their publication in
the Federal Register, and it is intended that users rely on changes
indicated in this document that post-date the most recent Federal
Register publication with respect to a particular sanctions program
in the appendices to chapter V of Title 31, Code of Federal
Regulations.  Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and
will be reflected as soon as practicable in the Federal Register
under the index heading "Foreign Assets Control."  New Federal
Register notices with regard to Specially Designated Nationals or
blocked entities may be published at any time.  Users are advised
to check the Federal Register and this electronic publication
routinely for additional names or other changes to the listings. 
Entities and individuals on the list are occasionally licensed by
OFAC to transact business with U.S. persons in anticipation of
removal from the list or because of foreign policy considerations
in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official
Federal Register publication of a notice of removal based on the
unblocking of an entity's or individual's property is reflected in
this publication by removal from the list.  Current information on
licenses issued with regard to Specially Designated Nationals and
other blocked persons may be obtained or verified by calling OFAC
Licensing at 202/622-2480.  The following changes have occurred
with respect to the Office of Foreign Assets Control Listing of
Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons since January 1,
2001:

01/19/01:      The President issued Executive Order 13192
prospectively lifting economic sanctions against the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and permitting new
transactions involving most of the entries listed with "[FRYK]" on
the alphabetized master list of Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons.  All property involving "[FRYK]" entries blocked
prior to January 19, 2001 remains blocked except as authorized, in
general license or otherwise, by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control.   The Executive Order continues and imposes sanctions on
specified parties (listed with "[FRYM]" on OFAC's alphabetized
master list). Transactions related to entries listed with "[FRYM]"
must be interdicted and need to be blocked on an ongoing basis. 
Because some "[FRYK]" entries have also been designated as "[FRYM]"
entries, those parties may appear both "above the line (as
'[FRYM]')" and "below the line (as '[FRYK]')" entries.  The
original entries with the designation "[FRYK]" have been segregated
in the SDN list because property blocked involving them prior to
January 19, 2001 remains blocked under the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro) Kosovo Sanctions Regulations:

08/24/01:      Dramatically shrinking the file sizes of OFAC's SDN
list and making it easier to download, OFAC has removed appendices
covering "[FRYK]," "[FRY S&M]," and "[SRBH]" entries from its
publications.  On January 17, 2001, President Clinton had issued
Executive Order 13192 lifting with respect to future transactions
remaining sanctions imposed on the Governments of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia & Montenegro) and the Republic of
Serbia pursuant to Executive Order 13088, as amended by Executive
Order 13121. (Sanctions imposed on the Government of the Republic
of Montenegro had previously been suspended by OFAC general
licenses).  Because Executive Order 13192 requires all property
blocked before January 19, 2001, to remain blocked due to the need
to address possible claims and encumbrances involving the property,
a separate, comprehensive list of "[FRYK]" entries will still be
available upon special request from OFAC's Compliance Programs
Division at (202) 622-2490.  Similar lists will be available with
respect to persons whose property and interests in property
continue to be blocked pursuant to part 585 of 31 CFR chapter V
("[FRY S&M]" and "[SRBH]" entries).

The address information for VEBA OIL LIBYA GMBH (a.k.a. VEBA OIL
LIBYAN BRANCH, a.k.a. VEBA OIL OPERATIONS B.V., f.k.a. MOBIL OIL
LIBYA, LTD.) has also been corrected to read "P.O. Box 2537"
instead of "P.O. Box 2357."

09/10/01:      The following variations on a new [FTO] entry have
been added to the list of Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons -

AUC (a.k.a. AUTODEFENSAS UNIDAS DE COLOMBIA; a.k.a. UNITED SELF-
DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA) [FTO]
AUTODEFENSAS UNIDAS DE COLOMBIA (a.k.a. AUC; a.k.a. UNITED SELF-
DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA) [FTO]
UNITED SELF-DEFENSE FORCES OF COLOMBIA (a.k.a. AUC; a.k.a.
AUTODEFENSAS UNIDAS DE COLOMBIA) [FTO]

09-24-01 (effective date) / 10-01-01 (additional descriptor
information added): The following are changes to entries already on
OFAC's SDN list prior to Executive Order 13224--Blocking Property
and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, Threaten to
Commit, or Support Terrorism.  "[SDGT]" stands for "Specially
Designated Global Terrorist."
