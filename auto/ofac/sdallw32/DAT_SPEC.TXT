                   First Released: 12/06/2004

PLEASE NOTE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE TECHNICAL STRUCTURE
OF THESE FILES ARE FEATURED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DOCUMENT

     OFAC is now publishing its list of Specially Designated Nationals in XML
and Comma delimited (CSV) format.  These  computerized publications as
transmitted by OFAC are designed as reference tools providing actual notice of
actions by OFAC with respect to Specially Designated Nationals and other
entities whose property is blocked, to assist the public in complying with the
various sanctions programs administered by OFAC.  The latest changes may appear
here prior to their publication in the Federal Register, and it is intended that
users rely on changes indicated in these documents that post-date the most
recent Federal Register publication with respect to a particular sanctions
program in the appendices to chapter V of Title 31, Code of Federal Regulations. 
Such changes reflect official actions of OFAC, and will be reflected as soon as
practicable in the Federal Register under the index heading "Foreign Assets
Control."  New Federal Register notices with regard to Specially Designated
Nationals or blocked entities may be published at any time.  Users are advised
to check the Federal Register and these electronic publications routinely for
additional names or other changes to the listings.  Entities and individuals on
the list are occasionally licensed by OFAC to transact business with U.S.
persons in anticipation of removal from the list or because of foreign policy
considerations in unique circumstances.  Licensing in anticipation of official
Federal Register publication of a notice of removal based on the unblocking of
an entity's or individual's property is reflected in these publications by
removal from the list.  Current information on licenses issued with regard to
Specially Designated Nationals and other blocked persons may be obtained or
verified by calling OFAC Licensing at 202/622-2480.  Format *.del consists of
records separated by carriage returns (ASCII character 13), with fields (values)
within records delimited by the "@" symbol (ASCII character 64).  Text values
are enclosed by quotation marks (")(ASCII character 34).  Format *.ff consists
of records separated by carriage returns, with fields within the records
beginning at fixed locations.  Format *.csv consistes of records seperated by
carriage returns (ASCII character 13), with fields  (values) within records
delimited by the "," (comma) symbol  (ASCII character 44).  Format *.PIP
consistes of records seperated by  carriage returns (ASCII character 13), with
fields (values) within records  delimited by the "|" symbol (ASCII character
124).  Null values for all four  formats consist of "-0-" (ASCII characters 45,
48, 45).

     The  @ Delimited (.del), Comma Seperated Values (.csv), Pipe  (|) delimited
(.pip) and Fixed-Field (.ff) releases consist of three  ASCII text files--a main
file listing the name of the SDN and other  information unique to that entity
(sdn.*), a file of addresses (add.*),  and a file of alternate names (alt.*).
Addresses and alternate names are linked to particular SDNs using unique integer
values in a linking or primary key column. The integers used are assigned for
linking purposes only and do not represent an official reference to that entity.

     Releases of the database-format files are intended as a service to the user
community.  OFAC's SDN list is published in the Federal Register.  All of OFAC's
lists are drawn from the same underlying data and every effort has been made to
ensure consistency.  The Federal Register will govern should differences arise. 
Due to the nature, urgency, and sensitivity of the programs  which OFAC
administers and enforces, it may not always be possible to  provide advanced
notice to users of format changes to the database  structure.

     The files associated with each release are:

@ delimited:     SDN.DEL, ADD.DEL, ALT.DEL
| delimited:	 SDN.PIP, ADD.PIP, ALT.PIP
fixed field:     SDN.FF, ADD.FF, ALT.FF
Comma delimited: SDN.CSV, ADD.CSV, ALT.CSV
XML:  	         SDN.XML	
Misc: dat_spec.txt (this file), sdn.xsd (XML SDN schema), sdnlist.txt 
(ascii version of the SDN list, non-delimited), ctrylst.txt 
(listing of all SDN entries categorized by country), prgmlst.txt 
(listing of all SDN entries categorized by program),sdnew94.txt, 
sdnew95.txt, sdnew96.txt, sdnew97.txt, sdnew98.txt, sdnew99.txt,

sdnew05.txt, sdnew06.txt, sdnew07.txt.
