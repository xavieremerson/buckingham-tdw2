VERSION

0.3 - 20 Jan 2005

DESCRIPTION
===========
MS-Excel stream handler


SYNOPSIS
========
This class read/writes a data stream directly from/to a Microsoft
Excel spreadsheet opened with the xlsfile:// protocol. This is
used to export associative array data directly to MS-Excel.


REQUIREMENTS
============
PHP4 >= 4.3.2


USAGE
=====
Include this file in your script, using include/require:

    <?php
        require_once "excel.php";
    ?>

To export an associative array to an Excel spreadsheet, simply
call fopen() using the registered stream wrapper protocol
xlsfile://, for example:

    $fp = fopen("xlsfile://path/to/file.xls", "wb");

This version expects an associative array in the form:
    $data = array(
        0 => array(
            "column1" => "value1",
            "column2" => "value2",
            "column3" => "value3",
            "column4" => "value4",
            "column5" => "value5",
        ),

        1 => array(
            "column1" => "value6",
            "column2" => "value7",
            "column3" => "value8",
            "column4" => "value9",
            "column5" => "value10",
        ),

        ...
    );

Now write your data array using a single call to fwrite():

    fwrite($fp, $data);

Then call fclose(), as you would normally.

    fclose($fp);


To download an excel spreadsheet:
    <?php
        header ("Content-Type: application/x-msexcel");
        header ("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"sample.xls\"" );
        readfile("xlsfile://path/to/sample.xls");
        exit;
    ?>
