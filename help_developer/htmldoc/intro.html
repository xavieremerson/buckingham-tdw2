This document describes how to use the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software, version
1.8.23. <I>HTMLDOC</I> converts Hyper-Text Markup Language ("HTML") input
files into indexed HTML, Adobe&reg; PostScript&reg;, or Adobe Portable
Document Format ("PDF") files. 

<P><I>HTMLDOC</I> supports most HTML 3.2 elements, some HTML 4.0
elements, and can generate title and table of contents pages. It does
not currently support stylesheets.

<P><I>HTMLDOC</I> can be used as a standalone application, in a batch
document processing environment, or as a web-based report generation
application.

<P>No restrictions are placed upon the output produced by <I>HTMLDOC</I>.

<H2>History</H2>

Like many programs <I>HTMLDOC</I> was developed in response to a need
our company had for generating high-quality documentation in printed
and electronic forms. For a while we used FrameMaker&reg; and a package
from <CODE>sgi</CODE> that generated "compiled" Standard Generalized
Markup Language ("SGML") files that could be used by the Electronic
Book Technologies ("EBT") documentation products (EBT is now owned by
<A HREF="http://www.inso.com">INSO</A>.) When <CODE>sgi</CODE> stopped
supporting these tools we turned to INSO, but the cost of their tools
is prohibitive to small businesses.

<P>In the end we decided to write our own program to generate our
documentation. HTML seemed to be the source format of choice since
WYSIWYG HTML editors are widely (and freely) available and at worst you
can use a plain text editor. We needed HTML output for documentation on
our web server, PDF for customers to read and/or print from their
computers, and PostScript for our own printing needs.

<P>The result of our efforts is the <I>HTMLDOC</I> software which is
available for UNIX&reg; and Microsoft&reg; Windows&reg;. Among other
things, this software users manual is produced using <I>HTMLDOC</I>.
