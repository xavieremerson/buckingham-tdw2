1. Requirements
------------------------------------------
To run properly, WinSysInfo needs a Windows NT based system (such as Windows NT, 2000 or XP) with
php (recommended > 4.3.0 with register_globals set to off.) and ofcourse a webserver :-).
It does not work on unix based systems, it is exclusivly for Windows.

2. Installation and configuration
------------------------------------------
There isn't much of an installation, just place the files in any directory you'd like, reachable by the web.
Configuration,
Open the file config.php
Set there the approperiate values.
NOTE ON CACHING: The directory you set the caching dir to, must be writeable by everyone.
It is recommended you set caching to 300 seconds (5 minutes.) as building the page can consume resources.

3. Templates
------------------------------------------
To use another template than the default one (aqua.htt), just open up config.php and go to TemplateToUse
variable. Set there the name of your template file from the templates directory.
If you create your own template, place it in the folder templates.
Do not forget to add the copyright notice.

The following templates are included within this release:

basic.htt (made by RedShift)
	Should give a start off to make your own template
	
default.htt (made by RedShift)
	Default template. Fairly simple. Blue with red bars.
	
aqua.htt (made by RedShift)
	Aqua template designed to reflect the look of MacOS X.

jorge.htt (made by Jorge)
	Nice template made by Jorge Schrauwen. Grey background with blue information fields. Very nice.
	

For creating your own templates, open up basic.htt and you'll see how it works.

4. Bugs and things to do
------------------------------------------
It is know that processor information is not display when use versions of php older than 4.3.0
This has to do with the variable scoping of PHP.
Oh and please run the script with register_globals set to off (I don't know what effect it has with it on)
